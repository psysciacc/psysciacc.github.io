summary: "This project is examining the gendered nature of prejudice by testing whether  prejudice toward a social group generally is more strongly related to prejudice towards its male members than its female members."
abstract: |
  When asked to imagine a person, people tend to think of a man (Hamilton, 1991). The same is true for some social groups as well–when asked to imagine a Black or White person, people tend to imagine a Black or White man (Schug, Alt, & Klauer, 2015). One reason for this is androcentrism: the belief that men are the default and women are the exception or “other” (Bailey, LaFrance, & Dovidio, 2018; Bem, 1993; Smith & Zarate, 1992).The present research will describe the gendered nature of prejudice for seven social categories (i.e., Black people, East Asian people, White people, police, politicians, and criminals). We hypothesized that, if prejudice occurs for the group, it is more strongly related to prejudice toward the men of that social category than toward the women of that category. This study was conducted across several laboratories and languages and was paired with PSA 002 for data collection.
