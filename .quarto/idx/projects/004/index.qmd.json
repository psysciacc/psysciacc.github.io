While some research has found evidence for these so-called Gettier intuitions (e.g., Machery et al., 2017a), Turri et al.

These results suggest that Gettier intuitions may be common across different scenarios and cultural contexts. When assessing the knowledge of others, lay people may rely on a shared set of epistemic intuitions (i.e., a core folk epistemology) that requires more than simply justification, belief, and truth.
