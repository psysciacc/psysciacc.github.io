We address the first challenge by leveraging a network of psychology labs to recruit a large Black student sample (*N~anticipated~* = 2700) from multiple US sites (*N~anticipated~* = 27).

This project should advance our knowledge of a scientifically and socially important topic: the conditions under which stereotype threat affects performance among current Black students in the United
