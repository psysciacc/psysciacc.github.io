We believe that many of the world's biggest challenges cannot be addressed by a single researcher or small team. We thus seek to leverage team science to address big questions rooted in theory and/or real-world problems. For example, of the 12+ projects in our [study portfolio](projects.html), we have:\n\n-   Tested whether COVID-19-related cognitive framing manipulations impact emotions, behaviors, attitudes, and well-being around the world.\n-   Examined cultural and situations forces that shape moral dilemma judgments.\n-   Examined the extent to which stereotype threat impacts academic performance among African American college students.\n-   And other cognitive and social psychology phenomena. Check our out projects [here](projects.html).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n<a href = \"https://shiny.thedoomlab.com/psadata/MemberMap\" target = \"_blank\"> Click here to view the member dashboard full screen.</a> It may take a moment to load below on this page.\n\n::: iframe-container\n<iframe src=\"https://shiny.thedoomlab.com/psadata/MemberMap\" width=\"100%\" height=\"800\" style=\"border:none;\">\n\n</iframe>\n:::\n",
