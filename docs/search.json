    "text": "Research projects completed by the PSA are typically selected from a pool of masked protocols submitted in response to an open call for proposals.\nOur most recent call for proposals, Second Special Call for Studies – Studying Generalizability with Global Samples, was released in December 2022 with a deadline of May 15, 2023. We do not currently have an open calls for submissions, but below is more information about what the process typically looks like.\n\n\nThe PSA occasionally releases general calls for studies from all areas of psychology. Proposed projects may be confirmatory or exploratory, test a novel research question or propose a replication, or explore the validity of measures or stimuli. When project proposals are submitted for consideration, authors are asked to explicitly address feasibility, implementation, and ethics concerns. Non-members can submit proposals, but must join the PSA if the project is selected.\nPSA projects are selected using a rigorous review process. Researchers submit detailed proposals for consideration. These proposals resemble Stage 1 Registered Reports (e.g., Chambers, 2013), and contain a theoretical introduction and hypothesis, a description of the planned sample and methods, and an analysis plan to test those hypotheses.\nThe proposals then undergo several rounds of review, overseen by the PSA’s Study Selection Committee (SSC). First, each proposal is screened for feasibility given the PSA’s current capacity and resources. Simultaneously, the SSC screens out submissions deemed low quality. Proposals that pass this screening are then sent out for peer review. Each proposal is reviewed by 5-10 reviewers, consisting of both PSA members and external experts. These reviewers are identified based on their ethical, methodological, and/or theoretical expertise related to a given proposal. All submissions are also rated quantitatively by members of the PSA network. The SSC then synthesizes the reviewer and network feedback to select projects for the PSA to pursue.\n\n\n\nSpecial calls for studies have specific requirements in addition to those of general calls. These may include stipulations about the research topic, design, or population of interest. See the Second Special Call for Studies – Studying Generalizability with Global Samples for example. Any differences from the standard study selection procedure summarized above are detailed in the call.\n\n\n\nIn some instances, researchers might benefit from a formal and flexible affiliation with the PSA. Affiliated projects are not guaranteed the direct support received by standard projects but are formally recognized and promoted by the network.\nThe Affiliated Projects policy document and submission form are in development are here."

The event was a testament to the power of collaboration and shared purpose.\nExpanded Leadership Team: We welcomed two new directors, two associate directors, and four assistant directors to our leadership team. Their expertise and enthusiasm have already begun to make a significant impact on the PSA’s work and direction.\nMembership Growth: We were delighted to see 862 new members join our Canvas platform, further expanding our community of researchers and collaborators.\nPublications and Submissions:\n\nTwo studies (PSA 004 & PSA DM) were successfully published this year, showcasing the impactful research conducted by PSA.\nTwo additional studies (PSA 003 & 007) were submitted for publication, and PSA003 recently received a revise and resubmit decision at PLoS One —an exciting step forward for our collaborators. PSA002 is still under review at Current Psychology.\n\nOfficial Non-Profit Status: A major milestone this year was becoming an official non-profit organization. This achievement has provided us with our own bank account and financial freedoms, allowing us to manage our resources more effectively and expand our initiatives.\nBTS Proposals Workshop: We hosted an 8-week workshop on BTS (Big Team Science) proposals, fostering skill development and providing valuable guidance to participants. The workshop was met with enthusiastic participation and positive feedback.\n\nLooking Ahead The coming year promises to be just as exciting, with plans already underway for:\n\nNew Projects: With a growing network and increased capacity, we look forward to offering more opportunities for researchers to participate in impactful projects. We aim to launch six new projects, broadening the scope of our research and the opportunities for involvement.\nPolicy Development: Anticipate new policies that will enhance our operations and support our mission.\nIncreased Engagement Opportunities: We are committed to creating more ways for members to engage with the consortium, collaborate with peers, and contribute to meaningful research.\n\nAs we celebrate this year’s accomplishments, we remain deeply grateful for our vibrant network. Together, we are making significant strides in advancing research and creating meaningful change. Here’s to another year of growth and success!\nErin and Savannah"

    "section": "",
    "text": "(Donate to the project here)\nIn 2018, the Psychological Science Accelerator selected an unusual study to conduct. Instead of using the PSA network to achieve an international sample, this study focused on a hard-to-reach study population: Black American college students. Compared to previous studies, the project was also unusually applied-facing, as it focused on a theory that was developed to understand, and hopefully address, performance gaps in settings like college where strong performance could affect a person’s life trajectory.\nThe proposed project aimed to address potential weaknesses in the evidence for the theory while simultaneously demonstrating how we can use big team science to achieve the sample sizes needed for informative quantitative tests of theories about hard-to-reach populations. The budding PSA network saw merit in this project, and at least one journal has agreed, as the project was accepted in principle as a Registered Report at Nature Human Behaviour.\nFour years later and data collection is going strong. As of October 31, 2022, we have recruited 1025 Black college students into our project. This is a stunning accomplishment, and already puts our project among the largest ever studies of stereotype threat among Black American college students. This accomplishment has only been possible due to financial contributions from the project leadership team, which we have redistributed to data collection labs to defray the costs of participant recruitment.\nHowever, 1025 is still short of our goal of a minimum of 2000 participants. We now believe we need crowdfunding to reach our data collection goal.\nYou can donate to this project here. Any donations we receive that exceed our financial need will be donated to the PSA at project’s end, as we have relied heavily on PSA resources to make this project happen.\nHelp us finish an amazing – and, for psychology, historic – project, further demonstrating the potential of big team science for solving some of behavioral science’s most pressing problems.\n\n- The PSA Stereotype Thread administrative team"

Authors should indicate what distribution will be used to represent the predictions of the theory and how its parameters will be specified.\nFull descriptions must be provided of any outcome-neutral criteria that must be met for successful testing of the stated hypotheses.

    "text": "The Psychological Science Accelerator is a distributed network of researchers across the behavioral sciences. Great theoretical advances can be made by conducting studies with participants being members of rare populations, but power is necessarily small in single-center investigations (due to the populations being rare). With over 1200 labs from 82 countries on all six populated continents, the PSA has the ability to collect large-sample data from rare populations and advance theory. The PSA is able to contribute to the discovery of generalizable knowledge through a new initiative where researchers may propose a study using a rare population for strong theoretical testing."

    "text": "What is a rare population?\nFor this call, rare populations are defined in a broad manner: these include hard-to-reach samples whether because of logistical, geographic, cultural or other reasons. Examples include people extremely high or low on a given trait; people with a specific diagnosis; members of rare minority groups, trauma survivors and other vulnerable populations, and so on. Rare populations (broadly defined) that can be accessed across multiple countries globally are preferred to rare populations that can only be accessed within a specific country/region. This would ensure the engagement of the full PSA network, increased data gathering capabilities of the study and that the results are generalizable and not dependent on the idiosyncrasies of the local data collection."

    "section": "What makes for a strong submission?",
    "text": "What makes for a strong submission?\nA major factor of the proposals will be to use a study design where studying the rare population would contribute to a major theoretical advance, regardless of the outcome of the results. In this line, a broad range of methodologies are welcome, not only experimental/quantitative but also including descriptive, exploratory, mixed-methods and qualitative designs. Strong submissions should also justify the need for the use of the PSA network and resources.\n\nStage 1\nSubmit a 2-page proposal with a supplementary document. The proposal should include rationale for the study, the targeted rare population and the study design (including measures, protocols and data analysis).\nImportantly, the proposal should come with an additional supplementary document that details the steps to be taken for data gathering labs to access the rare population. As applicable, this document may include protocols to “filter” the general population, partnering with relevant local institutions, or any such criteria as to demarcate the population of interest and how to access them. This is important so PSA can review the feasibility of the proposal.\nNote: Rare Populations can be vulnerable and data collection in some countries can pose ethical or legal risk. Please consider this when preparing your submission and be prepared to submit (separate from the 2-page proposal) discussion of any ethical issues from an international, multi-lab perspective.\nStage 1 screening will be conducted blind to authors’ identity by the PSA Rare Populations Working Group with proposals first screened for depth of theoretical advance as well as feasibility.\n\n\nStage 2\nIf the 2-page proposal passes the first round, we will be requesting the proposers to write a more detailed proposal with an introduction and methods section in a format that can be submitted as a Registered Report to a major journal [e.g. here].\nThis longer proposal more fully details the theoretical contributions and methods of the study. Importantly, this should also discuss the specific ethical issues of studying the particular rare population of interest. Potential harms and protocols to mitigate these harms should be discussed.\nReview of Stage 2 Proposals will be conducted blind to the authors’ identity, and will be done by the PSA Rare Populations Working Group and content experts.\n\n\nTimeline\n\nDeadline for the 2-page proposal: April 15, 2022\nAnnouncement for successful proposals: May 6, 2022\nDeadline for the detailed proposal: June 10, 2022\nAnnouncement for any selected proposal: July 7, 2022\n\nInitial 2-page proposal with supplemental steps should be submitted using this Google form here.\nFor general inquiries, email John Protzko (protzko@gmail.com) with the Subject Line: PSA:RP Question."

    "text": "The PSACR Administrative Leadership Team\nHeather Urry, Hannah Moshontz, Charles Ebersole, Jeremy K. Miller,\nNicholas Coles, Maximilian Primbs, Erin Buchanan, Patrick S. Forscher\nOn March 13, 2020, the PSA put out a call for rapid and impactful studies on the psychological aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of the call was to initiate the PSA’s COVID-Rapid Project, or PSACR, which would test whether our “big team science” model of massively collaborative psychology could contribute to a psychological understanding of the pandemic.\nNow, a year and a quarter later, PSACR is bearing its first fruit. The scope of the project is staggering. According to our project methods, our project produced three core studies, a general health behavior survey, a dataset spanning over 47,000 participants and 44 languages and dialects in 110 countries, with a team of 467 collaborators. Moreover, we produced all these products on a budget of a bit less than $17,000 USD – of which $7,000 was donated by PSA members.\nJust as impressive were the hurdles we had to overcome to produce these results. We obtained ethics approval across all our data collection sites, a process that involved huge administrative back-and-forth. We coordinated a translation team of at least 268, who completed forward translation, backward translation, and cultural adjustment processes. We coordinated 18 lab grants and the purchase of 15 semi-representative panels. We maintained two servers for data collection, programmed the project in 44 languages in formr, and completed a massive process of debugging. To maintain quality control, we coordinated a process of internal review before executing the project and revision processes when writing the papers that communicated the results.\nWe believe that our scientific results justify this massive effort. Our project has produced three highly precise and global tests of questions that are both theoretically and practically important. Moreover, we have produced a huge array of project materials in 44 languages, as well as a massive, meticulously documented dataset ripe for secondary analysis. We hope our three core studies are the first of many scientific contributions that PSACR will produce and inspire.\nNone of these achievements would have been possible without the PSA’s most valuable resource, its members. PSA members gave freely and generously of their skills and resources to make this project happen. Moreover, given that the author lists for these projects exceed 400, they did so knowing that they might not receive adequate compensation for their effects in the currency that most matters in academia, credit.\nWe list the main materials of the PSACR project below. Below that, we profile five contributors to this project. We chose these contributors to highlight people from different countries and project roles – and especially some of our many stellar contributors who are early in their careers. Although we do not have space to profile all 467 of our contributors, we hope this does something to make visible some of the many invisible contributions to the PSACR project."

It also provides an opportunity to test theories about risk communication. As part of a larger Psychological Science Accelerator COVID-19 Rapid Project, a global consortium of researchers will experimentally test competing hypotheses regarding the effects of framing messages in terms of losses versus gains. We will examine effects on three primary outcomes: intentions to adhere to policies designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19, opinions about such policies, and the likelihood that participants seek additional policy information. Whereas research on negativity bias and loss aversion predicts that loss-framing will have greater impact, research on encouraging the adoption of protective health behaviour suggests the opposite (i.e., gain-framing will be more persuasive). We will also assess effects on experienced anxiety. Given the potentially low cost and the scalable nature of framing interventions, results could be valuable to health organizations, policymakers, and news sources globally.\n\n\nPSACR Study 002 Reappraisal (preprint; OSF)\nA global test of brief reappraisal interventions on emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic\nAbstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has increased negative emotions and decreased positive emotions globally. Left unchecked, these emotional changes might have a wide array of adverse impacts. To reduce negative emotions and increase positive emotions, we tested the effectiveness of reappraisal, an emotion regulation strategy which modifies how one thinks about a situation. Participants from 87 countries/regions (N = 21,644) were randomly assigned to one of two brief reappraisal interventions (reconstrual or repurposing) or one of two control conditions (active or passive). Results revealed that both reappraisal interventions (vs. both control conditions) had consistent effects in reducing negative emotions and increasing positive emotions across different measures. Reconstrual and repurposing had similar effects. Importantly, planned exploratory analyses indicated that reappraisal interventions did not reduce intentions to practice preventive health behaviours. The findings demonstrate the viability of creating scalable, low-cost interventions for use around the world to build resilience during the pandemic and beyond.\n\n\nPSACR Study 003 Self Determination (preprint currently under revision; OSF)\nA Global Experiment on Motivating Social Distancing during the COVID-19 Pandemic\nAbstract: Finding communication strategies that can effectively motivate social distancing continues to be a global public health priority during the COVID-19 pandemic as people around the world wait to be vaccinated. This cross-country preregistered experiment (n=25,718 from 89 countries) tested hypotheses concerning generalizable positive and negative outcomes of different motivational messages encouraging social distancing that either promoted personal agency (i.e., autonomy supportive), or pressured people with shaming and blaming tactics (i.e., controlling). Participants were randomly assigned to three conditions: an autonomy-supportive message promoting reflective choices, a controlling message that was restrictive and shaming, or no message, which functioned to capture the real-life communications participants had been receiving. Results partially supported experimental hypotheses: the controlling message elicited more defiance relative to the autonomy-supportive message and increased controlled motivation (engaging in social distancing out of guilt and fear of social consequences) relative to no message, but messages did not influence behavioral intentions. Additionally, motivation to engage in social distancing out of guilt and fear of consequences correlated with more defiance and less long-term behavioral intentions to engage in social distancing, whereas motivation to engage in social distancing out of a true understanding of why the rules are important and necessary yielded the opposite patterns. Overall, this work highlights the potential harm of using shaming and pressuring language in public health communication."

    "text": "Profiles of PSACR Contributors\n\nMiguel Silan\nMiguel Silan is a researcher in the Philippines affiliated with the University of the Philippines Diliman. He is working to organize the local methodological community to adopt the methods reforms and tackle the various issues of the credibility crisis.\n\n\n\nMigs is a long-time contributor to the PSA, first as a member of the Translation and Cultural Diversity committee, and more recently as the new Assistant Director of the Community Building and Network Expansion Committee (CBNEC). With the committee, he has co-organized the monthly PSA coffee hours, Slack engagement threads, the onboarding/welcome channel and is currently organizing a more targeted recruitment of PSA members in world regions that are under-represented in current memberships. With PSA working groups, he is also planning to establish an accessible expertise sharing within the PSA (“The Hub”) and to establish regional support groups that aims to increase culture sensitive and culturally specific research approaches. In the past Migs organized no less than three sessions for PSACON2020 and has been a frequent contributor on topics related to translation and measurement in different cultural contexts. For PSACR, Migs helped lead the development of the health behavior survey that accompanied the three core PSACR studies and was the language-wide coordinator for the Filipino versions of the PSACR project. \n\n\nBiljana Gjoneska\nBiljana is a Research Associate at the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts. She has a passion for multinational studies and has participated in eight, four of which were PSA projects. Biljana also loves truly global initiatives like the PSA, where she strives to increase the visibility of her beautifully weird and non-WEIRD country (North Macedonia) in the domains of social psychology and social neuroscience.\n\n\n\nBiljana is a more recent member of the PSA but has nevertheless been an extremely active contributor. She has participated in numerous PSA-sponsored hack-a-thons, including one on the PSA’s study selection process at PSACON2020. At PSACON2020, she presented a concept for auction of studies, that may help facilitate discussions and decision-making processes for preselection of PSA proposals. Her cumulative experiences with the PSA community inspired her to contribute to the PSA as one of its leaders; she was recently appointed as an Assistant Director on the PSA’s Ethics Committee. For PSACR, Biljana was the language-wide coordinator for Macedonian, for which she managed a team of five to complete the forward translations, backward translations, and cultural adjustments of our three core studies and the health behavior survey. Bilijana also contributed to the coding of location data for the general dataset; these data serve as the basis for the focal inferences in the three core studies.\n\n\nİlker Dalgar\nİlker is an Assistant Professor at Ankara Medipol University. He is also working on co-founding the Turkey Open Science Initiative, which aims to promote open and robust research practices, facilitate big team science, and facilitate discussion of and training related to research issues in Turkey.\n\n\n\nİlker has been a long-time contributor to the PSA as an Assistant Director of the Translation and Cultural Diversity Committee. In this role, İlker helped develop the PSA’s translation procedures and standards, which have by now been implemented in nine PSA studies. İlker has also led or assisted with three PSA-themed grant proposals, all focused around increasing the participation from researchers in world regions currently underrepresented in the PSA network. For PSACR, İlker served as the language-wide coordinator for Turkish, managing a team of thirteen to complete forward and backward translations, as well as cultural adjustments, for all three core studies and our health behavior survey.\n\n\nMaximilian Primbs\nMax is finishing his Research Master’s in Behavioural Science. In fall, 2021, Max will begin a PhD at Radboud University, the Netherlands, where he will study situational models of implicit bias.\n\n\n\nEven though Max joined the PSACR project very early in his career, he shouldered a huge responsibility as the project’s primary translation coordinator. For a project involving 44 languages, three primary studies, and a health behavior survey, as well as a translation team of at least 268 people, this was an enormous responsibility. The translation procedure was also more involved than is typical for many projects, involving separate forward translation, backward translation, and cultural adjustment stages. Max rose to the occasion, ensuring this massive task got done in a timely way and assisting team members with troubleshooting when issues inevitably arose. This huge responsibility whet Max’s appetite for “big team science”; Max ran for and won a seat as an Assistant Director of the Translation and Cultural Diversity Committee and has helped organize two PSA-themed conference submissions.\n\n\nSavannah Lewis\nSavannah was a long-time research assistant in Chris Chartier’s lab. She has now transitioned into an Assistant Director position at the Ashland University International Collaborative Research Center. She will soon be looking for PhD programs, likely starting in 2022. \n\n\n\nSavannah was among the PSA’s first crop of interns. She has been the invisible glue holding the PSA together, safeguarding the PSA’s transition into a full-fledged organization. She has done everything from organizing the PSA’s first conference, PSACON2020, to running the PSA’s newsletters, to administering PSA004 Accelerated CREP. For the PSACR projects, Savannah assisted with general administration and technical implementation. In these capacities, she helped manage the master spreadsheet that tracked general project progress and the complex web of interlocking spreadsheets and software that transformed the 44 language versions of the PSACR project into 44 functioning formr surveys."

PSACR-001 is revising their manuscript based on team feedback. PSACR-002 has been accepted with minor revisions at Nature Human Behavior, and all co-authors are reviewing the submission and updating their authorship information over the next 10 days. PSACR-003 is revising their manuscript based on team feedback. Erin Buchannan is also drafting a data paper that describes the method of the bundled project. Once this manuscript is ready, we will share the draft with the entire PSACR team (i.e., all data collection labs, translators, etc.), who are invited to serve as co-authors.\n\n\nA note from the amazing Charlie Ebersole (former Interim Director)\nOver the last few months, I got to see the PSA from a new perspective, serving as its interim director. I came into this role through a very competitive process among the Associate Directors - that being that I was the only one who wasn’t currently teaching and/or raising very small children. In hindsight, though, I’m incredibly grateful for this somewhat random opportunity. I gained a lot from this experience, but what I will take most from it is hope. I am more hopeful than I have been in some time for psychological research, researchers, and our ability to maybe make the world a bit better. That’s because of you all.\nThe greatest strength of the PSA is our collective knowledge and effort. I knew that before I served as director. However, I didn’t realize just how strong we were as a network. The PSA is filled with more smart, talented, hard-working people that actually want to improve things than I had ever gotten to see before. It is genuinely inspiring. There is more knowledge and experience in this group than I could ever hope to acquire in a career, and I’m thankful that I got to learn from more of you over the last few months.\nThere are a lot of issues that the PSA will continue to grapple with. We’ve struggled to live up to some of our values in terms of global representativeness at all levels of the organization. Finding funding continues to be difficult. However, I feel very confident that we’ll be able to overcome the challenges we face and continue to build a stronger, more impactful, and more inclusive network. That confidence comes from working with you all. You are an incredible group of scholars and humans. It was my honor to serve as director of such a great collection of people.\nThanks everyone, Charlie\n\n\nElections for Director and Associate Director:\nWe are pleased to announce that the most recent PSA election has come to its conclusion. With 187 completed ballots cast, the PSA expressed confidence in Nicholas Coles (@coles_nicholas_) to serve as director, and selected Erin Buchanan (@aggieerin) and Lisa DeBruine (@LisaDeBruine) to serve as Associate Directors. All three have accepted the positions and will start Friday, April 23. Congratulations and THANK YOU, Nicholas, Erin, and Lisa.\nIt is always tough when there are many more wonderful candidates than there are positions to fill. As we collectively wish Nicholas, Erin, and Lisa well in their new roles, let's also offer our thanks and kudos to all the candidates for their willingness to throw their hats into the ring. I’m sure I’m not alone in appreciating the great ideas and thoughts that went into the statements and conversations on Slack. THANK YOU, Hans Rocha IJzerman (@hansijzerman), Jessica Flake(@JkayFlake), Sandersan (Sandy) Onie (@DrSandersanOnie), Gerit Pfuhl (@Gerit_Pfuhl), and Rima-Maria Rahal (@rimamrahal).\nLet's also please offer our thanks and kudos to our election tellers, Crystal Steltenpohl (@CrystalNSYoung), Ilker Dalgar (@IlkerDalgar), and Max Primbs (@MaxPrimbs). They were on the receiving end of a LOT of emails and did their due diligence to ensure a fair and accurate process. THANK YOU, Crystal, Ilker, and Max.\nWe're all very lucky that we get to work and think with bright people the world over!  \nBest, \nHeather Urry\n\nA special thank you to Heather Urry\nWe also would like to thank the amazing Heather Urry (@HeatherUrry) for coordinating these elections. This was the biggest election process that the PSA has seen so far, and she did a FANTASTIC job coordinating everything. To give you an idea of her contribution to this election, we have listed a few tasks that she worked on during this process (This is not a complete list of her contributions). She managed the nominations, contacted each of the nominations to see if they were still interested, collected and distributed the statements, answered questions about the process, created each candidate's Slack channels, kept the entire network up to date and in the loop, set up the election ballot, and analyzed the election outcome data. So, if you have a moment to send Heather a Slack, direct message, or email, please thank her for her amazing work to make this election happen!\nCommunity Building and Network Expansion\nWe have implemented monthly social events to allow new members to get integrated into our community. Everyone is welcome to join these meetings to get to know other members in our network. Here is the link for each month's meeting! We will post the dates for each month on the PSA gcal. \nIf you want to keep up to date with the various events that are happening on the PSA Network, subscribe to our calendar via Gmail or Outlook, depending on what you use! This should be the link to the calendar.\nAnother initiative the CBNE committee is implementing is Community Energizing threads- informal Slack threads to help members get to know each other better, their works, ideas, approaches, etc. [Similar to the idea of ’themed discussion days' on certain subreddits, if you're familiar with Reddit]. The community building committee thought it was a good time to bring it back! Absolutely all members are welcome to join in. Feel free to make the thread messy, especially if you want to reply to the responses you find to be interesting, or with topics you find similar interests on. We will be posting these periodically so be on the lookout for these threads."

Chris guided the PSA from an idea to a vibrant organization with more than 1400 members. Although he will no longer be the PSA’s director, he may yet transition into a different PSA role. In the meantime, Charlie Ebersole will serve as acting Director of the PSA and we will begin the process of holding an election for a new Director. \nBelow you will find Chris’s farewell message to the PSA. \n“I can’t wait to watch, and support, the PSA through this transition and into the next chapter of it’s growth. I'm a bit sad to step away from this role, because it has been such a personal joy to serve in this way, but I'm also very excited to see all the amazing things the PSA will accomplish with a new Director who can give the organization the energy, attention, and care it deserves. \nI've enjoyed working with each and every one of you immensely. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for making these last 3 and a half years of my life so special and meaningful. It's a period of my life that I will always cherish and look back on fondly. I won't be disappearing from the PSA of course, but I'm not yet sure what my next role/type of contribution will be.\nAs for the practical matters of this transition, Charlie Ebersole will serve as Interim Director until the Associate Directors group can complete an election process for the new Director (thank you, Charlie!!).\nOnward!”\n\n\nAppointments and Elections:\nThe PSA will be replacing several of its leadership positions in the coming months.  Below is a quick rundown of each.\n\nAssistant Directors\nThe Assistant Director positions are replaced by appointment of the Associate Directors. We have openings for positions in the following six committees:\n\nFunding\nEthics\nCommunity Building and Network Expansion\nData and Methods\nTraining\nTranslation and Cultural Diversity\n\nAfter January 30th, the Acting Director and the Associate Directors will select the new Assistant Directors from among the nominees.. If you have any questions about this application or this process, contact the Acting Director, Charlie Ebersole, at cebersole@virginia.edu. .\n\n\nDirector and Associate Director\nThis Spring, the PSA will be electing a new Director and one Associate Director. These positions will be filled by a direct election from the PSA network. Any PSA member may run for these positions. \nLater this month, the PSA leadership will solicit nominations (self or others) for these roles and we plan to conduct the election process over the next two months. If you have any questions about the election process or what’s involved in the positions, contact the Acting Director, Charlie Ebersole, at cebersole@virginia.edu.\n\n\n\nReflections on funding the PSA\nFunding lead Patrick Forscher and Associate Director Hans IJzerman published a blog reflecting on how to fund the PSA. This blog follows up on two previous blogs, one that reflects on the PSA’s resources for running studies, and a second that reflects on the financial cost of the PSA’s vision for itself.\nThe new blog lays out the makings of a funding strategy for the PSA. It lays out four possible sources of future funding: grant writing, charitable giving, fees-for-service, and membership fees, and weighs the strengths and weaknesses of each possibility. The blog also contains two surveys to solicit member feedback about the ideas within the blog.\nThis is an important post, as it concerns the future of the PSA. If you are interested in shaping the PSA’s strategy for financial sustainability, please give it a read."

    "text": "Patrick S. Forscher and Hans IJzerman\nIn 2017, Chris Chartier shared a blog post that revealed a grand vision for psychology research: psychologists could build a “CERN for psychology” that does for psychology what particle accelerators have done for physics. This “CERN for psychology” would be an organization that harnessed, organized, and coordinated the joint efforts of psychology labs throughout the world to take on large, nationally diverse big team science projects.\nThe months after Chris’s blog went live revealed that enough people believed in this vision to start building this “CERN for psychology”. These early efforts would evolve into the Psychological Science Accelerator, a network that, according to our recent study capacity report, now spans 1400 members from 71 countries. In these early months, the PSA also collaboratively developed a set of five guiding principles, namely diversity and inclusion, decentralized authority, transparency, rigor, and openness to criticism, that form a coherent vision for the type of science we want psychology to be. We want to help transform psychology to become more rigorous, transparent, collaborative, and more representative of humanity writ large.\nNow, three years after its founding, the PSA stands at a crossroads. This crossroads relates to our broad vision of what the PSA is and should be and the means through which we achieve that broad vision. This post will cover the first issue. As we will describe, we believe our early documents point to a vision of the PSA as active, rather than passive, but that a lack of funding streams constrains our ability to achieve that mission.\nMinimal and maximal visions of the PSA\nAlthough the PSA was established to coordinate the activities of research labs, there are a wide range of options as to how this coordination is implemented. The specific implementations anchor two radically different visions of the PSA: a minimal vision and a maximal vision.\n\nImagine a PSA that is radically different from the one we have now: the PSA as a mailing list. \nThis mailing list contains the contact information of people who are willing, in principle, to participate in team science projects. To use the mailing list, people design a team science study and email a description of the study to the list. People who receive a study invitation through the mailing list and freely reply to the study proposer. The mailing list itself is unregulated, so there is no vetting process for any of the emails people send over it, nor is there any support for the people who send invitations through the mailing list. This vision of the PSA is highly minimal in the sense that the PSA plays very little role in coordinating or implementing team science projects. However, this vision is also very low cost, as mailing lists are cheap to set up and almost free to maintain. In a sense, this minimalist version of the PSA already exists in the form of StudySwap -- a useful tool, but not a transformative one.\nNow imagine a PSA that is a bit more similar to the one we have now: the PSA as an active implementer of big team science projects.\nIn this vision, the PSA completes all stages of the team science research process. This means that the PSA takes partial ownership over its projects and participates in project decisions. This includes selecting projects to undertake through a rigorous review process, assisting with the theoretical development of studies, and improving on the design of studies by soliciting multiple rounds of feedback from relevant experts. In this vision, the PSA also actively coordinates and manages study teams to ensure that relevant administrative procedures (such as ethics review) are followed and to ensure that the various stages of the project occur on a reasonable schedule. The PSA also takes an active role in communicating completed projects to the world, perhaps by managing its own journal (the Proceedings of the Psychological Science Accelerator) and through its own dedicated press team. Finally, in this vision, the PSA has a variety of procedures to proactively improve its processes, including novel methods research, team science best practice research, project retrospectives, and exit interviews of PSA staffers who decide to leave the organization. This is the deluxe vision of the PSA, a PSA that is active but that requires lots of money and staff to maintain.\nThese two visions of the PSA -- the minimal and maximal -- also anchor an entire universe of in-between visions that are not so extreme. However, what is arguably true is that the vision of the PSA laid out in Chris’s blog post, as well as the one implied the PSA’s five guiding principles, are both much closer to the maximal vision of the PSA than the minimal one.\nMoney is necessary to implement a maximal vision of the PSA\nIf we accept that fulfilling the PSA’s mission requires something closer to a maximal vision of the PSA, we need to find ways to build the PSA into this more maximal vision. At a minimum, building and maintaining a maximal vision of the PSA requires people who can do the activities involved in this maximal vision. These people need to be recruited, managed, and retained, otherwise they will work at cross purposes, get into interpersonal conflicts, and burn out. In short, in addition to the people who carry out the PSA’s vision, the PSA needs an administrative structure to help these people carry out their work.\nThe PSA does, in fact, have a defined administrative structure. We have, for example, defined a set of committees to govern its activities and a set of roles that should be filled for each project. These roles outline an aspiration for the PSA to proactively conduct team science research -- further suggesting that the PSA has a maximalist vision for itself.\nThese roles are many. Our recent evaluation of the PSA’s administrative capacity identifies fully 115 of them. If we assume that each position requires 5 hours per week of work to complete the associated responsibilities, the 115 roles require 29,900 hours per year to staff. Unfortunately, maintaining this level of labor has, at times, been challenging because of our reliance on volunteers who have other daily commitments (such as jobs that pay them).\nWe can rely on volunteers to carry this load for a time, but doing so carries some real risks. For example, the heavy load can risk burning out the most active volunteers who take on the most labor and lead to large, costly mistakes if the labor requirements for large projects are not met. This load can also provoke interpersonal conflict if active volunteers feel that their labor is not properly recognized or credited. Finally, there are risks associated with who is able to be a volunteer: in a volunteer model, only those who can afford to will donate their time and efforts to the PSA. This squeezes out the voices and talents of some of the very people the PSA wants to elevate, such as those from Africa, Middle America, and South America. Our 2020-2021 study capacity report estimates that 90% of all people involved in administrative roles are from North America and Western Europe. The majority of these, 63% of all administrative roles, are located in North America.\nOther growing organizations have managed the transition from an exclusively volunteer organization to one that is funded by some sort of income stream. We can learn from their history, which shows that the organizations that became sustainable did so by leveraging their already-existing strengths.\nThe first step down the path of creating a sustainably funded organization involves acknowledging that many of the positions outlined in PSA policies are best served, not as volunteer positions, but as paid positions. We must also acknowledge that the costs of paying for this labor may be high. If we assume that all 29,900 hours are paid, and paid at even a very low wage ($7.25/hour, or US minimum wage), we still get a labor cost of at least $216,775 per year. This does not consider taxes, vacation, or other overhead. \nOf course, it may not be necessary to pay for all 29,900 hours, either because our staffing estimates are inaccurate, or because our labor becomes more efficient when we switch to a paid model. Yet the mere act of thinking through these considerations requires recognizing that the PSA’s maximalist vision has a financial cost.\nWhat we can be is constrained by our ability to obtain resources\nThe vision of the PSA outlined in its founding documents is grand. If implemented successfully, this vision could have an impact on psychology that is transformative, creating a science that is more inclusive, more collaborative, more transparent, and more robust.\nYet the PSA cannot realize this vision of itself for free. Currently, the PSA attempts to be a maximalist institution on a minimalist budget. That has worked during the PSA’s early years, but such a model may not be sustainable long-term. If we wish to implement a maximal vision for the PSA, we will need to focus dedicated energy into obtaining the funding needed for this implementation. As we will describe in a follow-up post, this will likely require developing funding streams outside of the traditional grant mechanisms to which scientists are accustomed.\n---\nFunding Note: Patrick Forscher is paid via a French National Research Agency “Investissements d’avenir” program grant (ANR-15-IDEX-02) at Université Grenoble Alpes awarded to Hans IJzerman."

    "title": "How many resources does the PSA possess?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Patrick S. Forscher, Bastien Paris, and Hans IJzerman\nHow many resources does the PSA possess? This is a question that affects many activities within the PSA -- prime among them the annual decision of how many studies the PSA is able to accept. Here are a few other examples:\n\nPeople involved in the selection of studies must decide whether the PSA can feasibly support studies with special requirements, such as a proposal to conduct a multi-site EEG project or a project involving a low-prevalence (and therefore difficult to recruit) population. \nPeople involved in writing PSA-focused grants must be able to accurately describe the size and scale of the network to make their grant arguments and planning concrete. \nPeople involved in managing the PSA’s finances need to know the people and projects that have the highest financial need. \nPeople involved in regional recruitment need to know how many members are currently located in a specific world region and the number of participants those members can muster for a typical PSA study. \n\nIn its first three years, we have had to rely on ad hoc sources to answer questions about PSA resources. Today, with the release of the PSA’s first study capacity report, we now have a source that is more systematic. This blog describes the logic that underlies the report, gives some of its top-level findings, and outlines what we plan to do with the report now that we have it.\nHow to think about and report on PSA resources\nThe PSA’s most basic activity is running multi-site studies, and one of the most fundamental resource-dependent decisions PSA leadership must make is how many proposals for these multi-site studies the PSA will accept. Thus, a single multi-site study provides a useful yardstick for measuring and thinking about PSA resources.\nThe PSA’s newly-ratified resource capacity policy takes just such an approach. It considers PSA resources from the perspective of helping PSA leadership decide how many studies they should accept in a given year. From this perspective, the most basic unit of analysis is the study submission slot, a promise by the PSA to take on a new multi-site study. Study submission slots are limited by at least two types of resources:\n\nData collection capacity. This is the PSA’s ability to recruit participants for multi-site studies. Data collection capacity is mainly governed by the number of PSA members located in psychology labs throughout the world. However, money can also expand the PSA’s data collection capacity; the PSA has occasionally contracted with panel-provider firms to recruit participants on its behalf.\nAdministrative capacity. This is the PSA’s ability to perform the administrative tasks required to support multi-site studies. Administrative capacity is mainly governed by the availability of labor, whether that labor be paid or volunteer.\n\nThe resource capacity policy also allows for the possibility of study slots that add on special requirements or evaluation criteria. These special submission slots might require, for example, that any studies submitted for consideration to that slot involve EEG equipment. Alternatively, the slots might require that the submitted studies involve investigating the psychological aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic. We will go into more detail about how we think about these special submission slots in a later post. For the time being, we simply note that assessing our resource capacity will allow us to understand the sorts of special submission slots we can accommodate.\nThe PSA’s data collection and administrative capacities are both in flux. The PSA’s ability to accommodate more specialized types of studies also fluctuates on a yearly basis. Moreover, the PSA is committed to the cultural and national diversity of psychology research -- activities that are dependent on its reach in under-resourced countries. Accurate assessment of all these capacities therefore requires ongoing documentation of its members, member characteristics (including country of origin), and its yearly activities. Currently, our documentation happens in a shared Google Drive, Slack, the PSA’s OSF project and the subprojects for each of its studies, and the recently-created PSA member website.\nAccording to policy, these various sources of documentation are consulted in a comprehensive way to form a complete picture of the PSA’s resources. This consultation results in an annual  study capacity report, which can inform decisions and activities involving the PSA’s resources.\nFindings from the first study capacity report\nThe first PSA study capacity report is large and comprehensive. Here are some big-picture findings:\n\nThe PSA currently has 1,400+ members from 71 countries.\nOut of seven studies, six are still underway collecting data.\nBased on our past data collection capacity, we have the ability to recruit a minimum of 20,000 participants over the upcoming scholarly year for new PSA projects.\nTwo out of three PSA members come from North America (24%) and Western Europe (41%). \nWe do not have sufficient information to accurately estimate the number of administrative hours available for each PSA role.\n\nHowever, these big-picture findings hide a lot of important detail that may be important for PSA decision-making. For example, here are a few additional tidbits that come out of the report:\n\nThe number of PSA member registrations almost tripled as a result of the COVID-Rapid project.\nAt the time of the report’s writing, and excluding PSA007, the PSA will need to recruit 30,000 participants to complete its active roster of projects.\nAbout 20% of the PSA’s membership have a social psychology focus area.\nAbout 90% of people in active PSA administrative roles are located in North America (63%) and Western Europe (21%).\n\nIf you’re interested in digging into more of these details, you can find the full report here.\nWhat’s next?\nAs outlined by policy, the main purpose of the report is to inform decisions about how many studies the PSA can accept in the next wave of study submissions. Thus, an important next step for this report is for the upper-level leadership to use the report to come to a decision about study submission slots.\nHowever, the study capacity report has already catalyzed a number of ongoing conversations about what the PSA is, what it should be in the future, and how the PSA should go about meeting its aspirations for itself. Some of these conversations have resulted in their own dedicated blog posts, which will be posted to the PSA blog in the next few days.\nIn the meantime, we welcome your thoughts about the PSA’s study capacity and issues related to it. We believe that compiling this report has been a useful exercise precisely because the process of compiling the report has inspired so many useful conversations about the PSA’s direction and goals. This reinforces our commitment to maintaining this useful reporting structure in future years.\n---\nFunding Note: The study capacity report was made possible via the work of Bastien Paris; his internship at Université Grenoble Alpes is funded by a grant provided by the Psychological Science Accelerator.

Thanks to the hard work of Merle Schuckart, we have drafts of the new programs and are in the process of ensuring that the web versions of the studies retain fidelity to the original protocols and troubleshooting the studies. The new version of the experiment should fully integrate both the 002 and 003 procedures into one online protocol, greatly simplifying future data collection.\nPSA 004: Data collection is still going on and will wrap up at the end of the year! We do however need more CREP reviewers as we wrap up this project at the end of the year. CREP reviewers look over each lab’s OSF page to ensure that each lab is performing the study as planned. If you or someone else is interested please have them fill out this form.\nPSA 005: We have finished our latest revision of the stage 1 manuscript based on our communications with the editor. This should be the last revision before stage 1 acceptance. The newest revisions were submitted on Wednesday!!!!\nPSA 006: 006 will continue data collection through the end of 2020. We have collected lots of great data from all of our members and are excited to see this study through to the end.\nPSA 007: PSA’s new project: Semantic Priming Across Many Languages (SPAML) is just getting started. Learn more by checking out the presentation from the conference: click here! The words2manylanguages part of the project is currently recruiting all kinds of help. We are trying to create a repository of datasets to use as our criterion for the modeling section of this project. We downloaded a bunch of them, but we need to clean them up to a consistent format (naming, csv column names synced, etc.). Anyone who’s interested in helping will be given credit via CREDIT (so this task would count + reviewing the paper for authorship). You can email buchananlab@gmail.com. Join slack or email to be kept updated on the two other pre-projects, more announcements on those soon. All three will need to be completed as part of the design for the full 007 project.\nPSACR 001/002/003: Data collection is complete for PSACR 001 and 003, and PSACR 002 data collection is ending on October 23rd.

Email psacovid@gmail.com if you are interested in joining or have questions about joining.\nElection\nThe two candidates in our election for an open Associate Director position, Peter Mallik and John Protzko, have provided written statements describing why they've chosen to run, and describing what they'd like to achieve in the Associate Director role if elected. \nYou can read each statement by clicking the candidate's name here: Mallik and Protzko. Additionally, we have posted each statement in dedicated slack channels. I encourage all members to read them, consider them carefully, and ask any questions you have for the candidates! You can ask questions by joining the PSA slack workspace at this link, and then joining the #associatedirectorelection_protzko and #associatedirectorelection_mallik channels. The slack discussion closes today, but you can read the questions and answers throughout the election. Soon, we will email each PSA member with instructions about how to vote.\nConference\nApproximately ⅔ of the available seats are full, so make sure to register now to claim your spot if you’d like to attend. We have a recent surge of attendees requesting free admission, and would very much like to to be able to fill all requests, so we would be very grateful if a few additional members were able and willing to pay the $60 admission fee to open up more free spots. Also, the program is  slowly but surely filling up. If you have work or ideas you would like to present at the conference be sure to fill out of new submission form! We’ve started a general info page that highlights a few presentations already set and links out to the current draft program. We hope to have the full program set in late August and will share an update with the full network when it is ready to go!\nCurrent Studies\n\nPSA 001- The Stage 2 Registered Report has been resubmitted to Nature Human Behaviour. Now we are waiting for the final decision from the editor.\nPSA 002/003- The 002 and 003 teams are in the final stages of moving our experiments from Open Sesame/Qualtrics to Lab.JS. Thanks to the hard work of Merle Schuckart, we have drafts of the new programs and are in the process of ensuring that the web versions of the studies retain fidelity to the original protocols and troubleshooting the studies. The new version of the experiment should fully integrate both the 002 and 003 procedures into one online protocol, greatly simplifying future data collection.\nPSA 004- Data collection has slowed down as many members’ universities have concluded their semesters. We do however need more CREP reviewers as we wrap up this project at the end of the year. CREP reviewers look over each lab’s OSF page to ensure that each lab is performing the study as planned. If you or someone else is interested please have them fill out this form.\nPSA 005- 005 is waiting on a decision on our Stage 1 submission at Nature Human Behaviour.\nPSA 006- 006 is continuing data collection and is slated to finish sometime between October and December. We continue to have new labs join and are extremely excited to finish up this year!\nPSACR 001/002/003- The PSACR bundle is still collecting data. We now have over 19,000 participants (i.e., people who have completed the general questions about the pandemic and participated in one or more of the study surveys). The survey is offered in 38 (!!) languages and dialects, with a handful more to be implemented very soon. We are still planning to collect data as long as we can afford to, which we expect to be through August. We are also welcoming new labs to join data collection if they use one of the languages we've translated already (see here for a list of implemented and soon-to-be implemented languages http://formr.psysciacc.org/shiny/shiny_app/) . Email psacovid@gmail.com if you are interested in joining or have questions about joining.\n\nA Chapter on the PSA, QRPS, and Clinical Psych\nA group of PSA members, led by Julie Beshears, are beginning work on an invited chapter about the PSA and how the PSA's design can affect the presence of questionable research practices (QRPs) in clinical psychology research.  Ideally, they are seeking individuals with clinical experience, but other contributions are welcome.  If this project interests you, you may join the slack channel (proj_clinical_chapter) or email Julie at jebeshears@eagles.usi.edu.\nCommittee Updates\n\nEthics committee- We would like to congratulate our newest Assistant Director of the ethics committee!! Mike Mensink was just appointed the position last week and seems very eager to start in his new position. Welcome Mike and we look forward to collaborating with you soon!\n\n\n\nTranslation and Cultural Diversity Committee- The Translation and Cultural Diversity Committee (TCDC) would like to collect data on the translation capacity of the PSA for future projects: in which countries and for which languages do we have adequate potential translators? This knowledge will help us to determine our potential capacity, or lack-there-of, in many possible data collection languages, and thus make better plans for future projects. Please answer this very short, 1-minute survey, to help us. Thank you!!\n\n\n\nProject monitoring Committee- The member website is receiving an update soon. A big shout out to the fantastic Erin Buchanan for helping the team find a way to manage projects through Canvas. Erin will be going over this update and much more at the conference in September, so make sure you check that out for more information!\n\nRecorded for the Chinese Open Science Network Available Online \nChris Chartier recently gave a talk to the Chinese Open Science Network. They recorded the presentations and have posted it here, so anyone can watch and reach out with any questions or feedback (cchartie@ashland.edu). \nThank you for all that you have, and continue to do, on behalf of the PSA. Onward!\nSavannah and Chris"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The world is currently witnessing a public health crisis that is unprecedented in our lifetimes: the global COVID-19 pandemic. At the Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA), we are deeply concerned about the many impacts of this outbreak, but we are also optimistic about behavioral science’s potential to mitigate these impacts. With our network of more than 500 labs from over 70 countries, we believe that – with your help – the PSA can play a crucial role in this process. This can only occur if our member labs, and new labs who would like to join us, contribute to project administration and local data collection. Last week, we put out a call for rapid and impactful studies to understand the behavioral and psychological aspects of the COVID-19 outbreak. We received an overwhelming response. The community submitted a whopping 66 (!!) proposals. 141 PSA members voted on the 11 proposals that passed triage. Yesterday, we provisionally accepted the three proposals that received the most votes, with another four proposals on our “waitlist.” Waitlisted studies will come off the waitlist if we receive an overwhelming response during lab recruitment and if early preparation for our first three studies goes smoothly. We anticipate that all PSA COVID-Rapid studies will be bundled into a single data collection effort. You can read more details about the selected studies and the process of contributing to data collection here. We need your help. This project is big. We aim to recruit thousands of participants from all over the globe. We can only succeed with this aim through the collective energy of our members. You can contribute your time and expertise. One way to help is by joining the COVID-Rapid project. After joining, you can volunteer to manage the projects, translate the project materials into one of over 50 languages, or help with data collection by recruiting online participants from your local community. If you have questions about the process of joining the study, contact the PSA COVID-19 Gmail account at psacovid@gmail.com. To join this project:\n\nBecome a member of the PSA by registering at the member website\nLog in to the member website\nClick on My Lab &gt; Study Sign Up\nComplete your member profile at My Account &gt; Create Profile\n\nIf you wish to recruit participants for the project, you must be willing to do so fast. This will require very fast ethics approval and data collection. We anticipate that most sites will either join an existing IRB application as an investigator (e.g., the application at Chris Chartier’s Ashland University), ask their local IRBs to defer to an IRB that has granted us approval, obtain an ethics waiver because the study is minimal risk, or go through expedited review. We will work with you on the ethics process once you join the project. You can also contribute financially. To pull off a project of this magnitude, we also need financial contributions. For those who can, you can donate via PayPal. Every dollar received will be spent supporting this project. Financial contributions will be used to pay participants, aid with recruitment, compensate translators, and compensate other administrative contributors. The PSA has an opportunity to activate our global network to confront the global challenge of COVID-19. We will only succeed with your support and involvement. Together, we can harness the potential of behavioral science to further the public good."

    "text": "Scope of study proposals\nWe are soliciting proposals for studies that can be conducted online. Studies should be relatively easy to conduct. We are only interested in applied, not basic, research. Research proposals from multi-disciplinary teams (e.g., health researchers, psychologists, and data scientists) will be prioritized. Proposals should not exceed 1 page. This one page should include the basic research question, (very briefly) the relevant literature, identify whether the research is exploratory or confirmatory, and how the research will contribute to reducing the effects of the current crisis. If confirmatory, the researchers should clearly identify the hypothesis/hypotheses and the needed sample size for answering their research question. If exploratory, the researchers should identify how data will be used to generate hypotheses. In addition, if exploratory, the researchers will have to identify how they will use methods including - but not limited to - cross-validation for greater certainty about the generated ideas. If feasible and volunteers are available, the network may be able to assist with translation into the major world languages. However, if you need your study conducted in multiple languages, we encourage you to have a translation plan in place."

Currently, the Stage 2 Registered Report is under review at Nature Human Behaviour. For this project, we also launched the Secondary Analysis Challenge, which grants 10 awards of $200 to research teams that create and execute a pre-registered re-analysis of the project data. Currently, this secondary challenge has 8 submissions and all have been checked for computational reproducibility.\n002 Object Orientation and 003 Gendered Prejudice: 2019 was a busy year for the 002 & 003 team. We translated our materials into 16 different languages and implemented our procedure across 19 countries. We have completed data collection at 23 different sites, with more sites continuing their data collection into the spring. We hope to have the Stage 2 Registered Report manuscript under review at Psychonomic Bulletin & Review in 2020.\n004 True Belief: The Accelerated CREP collaboration is really picking up steam - 39 teams are collecting data (and more are welcome to join in here -- there is information at the top of the form with helpful links). We plan to wrap up data collection around June and work on the final manuscript shortly thereafter, to be reviewed as a Stage 2 Registered Report at Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science. There are still plenty of opportunities to get involved. Contact jordan.wagge@avila.edu or crep.psych@gmail.com for more information.\n005 Stereotype Threat: In 2019, we drafted the initial submission of our Stage 1 Registered Report for Nature Human Behaviour and received a strong revise and resubmit. We also submitted a revised version of the manuscript and are still waiting to hear back about the revision’s status. Finally, we recruited 27 collaborating labs to join the project, all of whom have secured IRB approval. If you wish to join too, you can read more about the project, and sign up as a collaborator, here.\n006 Moral Thinking: In 2019, this project's team also drafted their initial submission of a Stage 1 Registered Report and submitted it Nature Human Behaviour, received a positive revise and resubmit, submitted a revision, received another small R&R :), and are completing the new round of revisions now. We have 147 labs signed up to collect 18,637 potential participants. Most labs are ready to test the link and collect data! If you are interested in joining, you can sign up by filling out this form. Every lab is welcome, but we are specifically searching for collaborators who could collect data from at least 100 participants in India, South-Korea, Japan, or Thailand. The experiment will be run online, so collaborators can simply have to send out a link, and participants are not required to come to the lab."

The grant would deeply involve the PSA and provide it a substantial sum of discretionary money to be used as the PSA sees fit. Synergy Grants have three stages of review. Hans and Patrick will hear the results of the first stage in April.\nNational Science Foundation grant to be submitted this week. Chris Chartier, Neil Lewis, Jr., Heather Urry, Charlie Ebersole, and Hannah Moshontz have drafted a proposal to the NSF (our third try :) at this one) that will be submitted on the 15th. If funded, the grant would support hiring of a PSA dedicated project manager to allow us expanded data collection and more efficient overall workflow and study completion.\nJohn Templeton Foundation grant to be submitted this week.

We think you’ll have fun looking at and evaluating these excellent submissions! We also received a very interesting, but quite atypical submission, that we are collating feedback on. In response to our last call for studies, a research team submitted a proposal that is not so much a specific study, but rather an intriguing way in which we may select and develop a future study. The SSC found that it had promise, but that it didn't fit our typical model for submission review and selection. So, the SSC Assistant Directors decided to pull the submission from the standard review track, and instead begin a PSA-wide conversation to consider and eventually decide by consensus (or perhaps vote) if we should implement the proposal. Members, please provide your initial feedback by joining the conversation currently ongoing in our general Slack channel (scroll up to the thread beginning on November 27th)."

The project features state of the art methods to maximize transparency and study integrity. The study involves a computerized experiment taking about 20-30 minutes per session. Group testing is possible in a computer lab, no specialized equipment needed. Labs are expected to recruit at least 100 participants. Participants will be exposed to images with explicit erotic/sexual content in the experiment. No financial compensation is required for the participants. Data collection is expected to take place in the 2020 spring, and if needed, 2020 fall semester. Every material is provided for ethics/IRB submissions and data collection in English (translation of materials might be necessary by the collaborators). The study is pre-registered and the manuscript is accepted in principle for publication (IPA) in the journal Royal Society Open Science. Collaborators in data collection get authorship on the paper.

This worked OK for a while, but as our network grew it became disorganized, unwieldy, and error-prone. Lucky for us, Erin Buchanan has been working hard on a new membership website (complete with member database) and is ready for all PSA members to register and provide some information. Eventually, we hope the site can become a \"one stop shop\" for each PSA member to find information about the status and next steps for any PSA studies they have joined, and any PSA tasks that need new contributors. For now, we are asking all members of the PSA to create an account on the site, login in, and complete the member information form. Erin also put together this awesome tutorial video to walk you through the process!"

This document is a precursor to a more complete 5-year strategic plan to be drafted in 2020. We welcome feedback this month before editing and ultimately calling for a vote to make this statement a PSA policy.\n\n\nAnalysis Plan Approval Policy\nIn future projects, the Data and Methods (DM) committee intends to review the project analysis plan before the project is registered and/or submitted for peer review. This process is meant to ensure that all necessary components (sample size justification, analysis scripts, etc.) are present in the analysis plan when it is submitted for external review. Furthermore, the approval process should provide some minimum reassurance that major methodological issues and flaws in the analysis plan have been addressed before launch of data collection, in the very rare cases that such flaws escape the awareness of the co-author team. In line with the proposed guidelines for PSA policy proposals, the DM committee have sought and incorporated feedback from the PSA director and associate directors. We now invite all members of the PSA to provide feedback on the document, which can be found here. The document will be open for feedback for one week as of the posting of this newsletter. After this period the DM committee will incorporate feedback, and subsequently submit the policy for approval by vote by PSA Directors and all members of the PSA."

    "text": "We are releasing our draft vision document for feedback from anyone. You do not need to be a PSA member to comment, and we welcome your input via comments in the google doc or sent via email (psysciaccelerator@gmail.com). Soon after founding the PSA, we collectively established our mission statement, core values, selected our first studies, and drafted initial policies for how we conduct our projects. Then we got to work! We focused on the most pressing needs of planning and conducting our studies and setting up our organizational and governance structures. We now need to also focus on long-term planning to ensure the PSA is a sustainable project that works best for psychological science and its members. The current document represents an early step in our formal planning process in two ways: 1) it will undergo several rounds of feedback from PSA members prior to being voted on as possible PSA policy, and 2) if it is ratified it will form just one portion of a more detailed strategic plan to be drafted in 2020 and then reassessed annually thereafter. Before we can draft a full strategic plan that includes more specific activities, goals, funding strategy, and a projected budget, we need broad community buy-in on the ideas and basic plans outlined in the vision document. To that end, the draft now open for feedback from anyone (PSA member or not) during the entire month of September 2019. The PSA Directors will edit the document in response to this feedback during October, and we will put the revised document up for a vote by the PSA network during November. If the vision statement is not ratified during that vote, we will continue to iteratively solicit feedback, edit, and vote until a version has been ratified. If it is ratified during the November vote, it will be published on the PSA website in December. We will then begin the more detailed strategic planning process. The 5-year strategic plan will follow the same timeline in 2020 as this vision document is following in 2019. The Directors will draft the plan January through August, we will solicit feedback in September, we will edit in October, and all PSA members will vote in November. The process of assessing, revising, seeking feedback, and ultimately voting on the strategic plan will occur annually thereafter following the same month-by-month schedule. Thank you in advance for any feedback you provide!"

    "text": "Opportunity is distributed unequally in human affairs. Science is a human affair, so this dictum applies to science as it applies to any other human endeavor. At the PSA we recognize this as an unfortunate current characteristic of science, but we also think that science will be both fairer and of higher quality if opportunity were distributed more evenly. Working toward this aspiration is central to our core principles. However, we have some ways to go to meet it: of the over 500 labs that have joined our network, only 14% were in South and Central America, 5% in Eastern Europe, 6% in the Middle East, 4% in Asia, and 1% in Africa. Last year, we started an initiative to move us closer to our aspiration: we issued three small grants of $400 to under-resourced labs PSA labs. These grants helped these labs collect data and earn authorship on one of our studies. This year, we are continuing this program. While the exact number of grants we will be able to issue is uncertain, we hope to issue six grants of $400 each to PSA labs that wish to collect data for one of our studies. These grants will be funded using money collected from our Patreon if we meet our support goal (see this previous post for more details). We will select recipients based on the following two criteria:\n\nDemonstrated need. We define “need” to mean that the data collection could not happen without the provision of the grant. As an additional provision, and as an attempt to improve lab representation from non-Western countries, at least three of the grants will go to labs from those regions.\nBenefit to the PSA study in question. We will prioritize labs that provide a unique benefit to the PSA study in which they are participating. For example, in a study of how a psychological process varies across cultures, we will prioritize labs that allow the recruitment of participants from a culture that is not already represented in the study.\n\nOur current crop of accepted studies deal with topics ranging from language comprehension, to stereotype threat, to moral decision-making. Five of these six studies (002 through 006) are actively recruiting labs. We also have an active call for studies that ends September 15, 2019 that will give us a new wave of studies covering yet more topics. This provides prospective labs with the opportunity to join studies, and earn authorship on manuscripts, that match their interests. If you are interested in applying for one of these grants, fill out this form. We hope this initiative will play a small but measurable role in redistributing scientific opportunities in a fairer way."

    "text": "On August 26, 2017, Chris Chartier wrote a blog post posing a simple question: what might happen if psychology adopted the collaborative “big science” model seen in physics and built a “CERN for psychological science”? 2018 gave us a glimpse of the answer: a rapidly-expanding network of over 300 psychology labs from over fifty countries. The first year was a flurry of activity as, in quick succession, the PSA accepted four studies and had its first academic paper accepted. The network’s rapid expansion in its first year speaks to the hunger for ambitious solutions to two of the problems that psychology currently faces: lower-than-desired levels of replicability and generalizability of psychological findings. The PSA’s second year has marked the beginnings of a transition from idea to action. The network has continued to expand, now standing at over 500 labs from over 70 countries. We have selected 2 new studies, collected data from over 11,000 participants for our first study, initiated data collection in 3 other studies, received in principle acceptance for 2 registered report manuscripts, and submitted another 2 for stage 1 peer review. This productivity in the selection, preparation, and conduct of our studies was matched by a substantial organizational infrastructure development. PSA members named Assistant Directors to lead the committees that do the bulk of its administrative and coordination work, initiated a project to formalize its study pipeline, drafted a coherent set of policies dictating how the PSA manages and releases its data, made the PSA’s first full-time hire (Patrick Forscher at Université Grenoble Alpes), announced the first round of PSA elections, created a Patreon, submitted several grant proposals, and drafted a vision statement outlining the PSA’s long-term priorities. If the PSA’s first year was focused on growth and excitement, its second year was focused on turning plans into action and establishing sustainability, and we hope our third year is one of securing large-scale funding to more effectively pursue our mission with six key aims:\n\nCollect samples that represent all people\nTrain and support our global network of researchers\nExpand the PSA’s capacity to include more complex behavioral studies\nRelease large-scale data-sets that are maximally informative for secondary re-use\nImprove psychological science through meta-scientific and instructional contributions\nExpand capacity to conduct more, and bigger, studies\n\nBelow we have created a chronological timeline of important events in the PSA.
