    "text": "In order to slow the transmission of COVID-19, governments around the world are asking their citizens to participate in social distancing, that is, to stay at home as much as possible. In most countries, individuals have some choice over whether or not they follow recommendations for social distancing. Thus, understanding how to best motivate social distancing has become a critical public health priority. This study tests, in a confirmatory manner, whether self-determination theory-guided message framing impacts people’s motivation to participate in social distancing. Specifically, we expect autonomy-supportive messages that help people understand the value of behavior change to a) increase ‘buy in’, or autonomous motivation, for social distancing, b) lower feelings of defiance to follow recommendations around social distancing, and c) increase feelings of self-efficacy to participate in social distancing, relative to neutral and controlling messages. Further, we expect controlling messages that pressure people to change using shame, guilt, and threats, may backfire and a) decrease ‘buy in’ for social distancing and b) increase defiance, relative to the control condition. Exploratory tests will examine whether the effects of message framing on motivation and defiance extend to behavioral intentions and long-term commitment. This work has direct relevance for how public officials, health professionals, journalists, and others can communicate about solving this and future public health crises in ways that motivate people more effectively.\nLegate, N., Nguyen, T.

    "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic is eliciting intense and prolonged negative emotions that may detrimentally affect health and well-being globally. To enhance resilience, we will teach participants around the world to use a widely studied and generally adaptive form of emotion regulation—cognitive reappraisal—to reduce negative emotions and increase positive emotions. We will randomly assign participants to one of three reappraisal interventions (reconstrual, repurposing, and their hybrid) or a control condition. We predict that relative to the control condition, reappraisal will reduce immediate and anticipated negative emotions, increase immediate and anticipated positive emotions, and enhance emotion regulation self-efficacy. Importantly, we expect reappraisal to reduce intentions to engage in emotion-driven problematic behaviors (e.g., substance use) without reducing intentions to engage in healthy behaviors. Results will inform efforts to create a scalable intervention that governments, organizations, and citizens around the world can employ in order to build emotional resilience during the pandemic and beyond.\nDorison, C., Lerner, J.

    "text": "Semantic priming has been studied for nearly fifty years across various experimental manipulations and theoretical frameworks. Critically, the understanding of semantic priming relies on reliable, well-studied stimuli with defined similarity values. In the last twenty years, the publication rates of normed stimuli databases and corpora (i.e., large bodies of text) has exponentially increased. Further, newer computational models of concept representation have been detailed using these databases. Using these newer models, we can define similarity between concepts to create reliable stimuli for study in semantic priming. In this proposal, we outline the need for a database of semantic priming values, particularly in non-English languages. We detail the process for creating a large database of priming values, from which new theories and hypotheses can be examined. Further, we describe the novel outputs that this proposal will support including a framework for determining sample size for studies of this nature.\nBuchanan, E. M., Cuccolo, K., Coles, N.

    "text": "Random assignment to experimentally created and otherwise meaningless social groups is sufficient to create ingroup preference. This striking phenomenon, now referred to as the minimal group effect (MGE), has theoretical importance for explaining in-group biases and practical implications for anti-bias interventions. However, due to small and culturally restricted samples, as well as insufficient attention to moderators, the extent to which the MGE is a somewhat specialized or restricted phenomenon, or whether it can be considered a general human universal that underlies culturally salient forms of real-world bias, remains unknown. We aim to recruit a large sample of participants across cultures through the Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA)’s vast network to test the cultural prevalence of the MGE and to compare it to two forms of real-group bias (bias in favor of family members and bias in favor of national ingroups). We will examine the underlying mechanisms of the ingroup bias by testing the relationship between these forms of bias and a number of theoretically important individual- and cultural-level moderators."

    "text": "Over the past 10 years, Oosterhof and Todorov’s valence–dominance model has emerged as the most prominent account of how people evaluate faces on social dimensions. In this model, two dimensions (valence and dominance) underpin social judgements of faces. Because this model has primarily been developed and tested in Western regions, it is unclear whether these findings apply to other regions. We addressed this question by replicating Oosterhof and Todorov’s methodology across 11 world regions, 41 countries and 11,570 participants. When we used Oosterhof and Todorov’s original analysis strategy, the valence–dominance model generalized across regions. When we used an alternative methodology to allow for correlated dimensions, we observed much less generalization. Collectively, these results suggest that, while the valence–dominance model generalizes very well across regions when dimensions are forced to be orthogonal, regional differences are revealed when we use different extraction methods and correlate and rotate the dimension reduction solution.\nJones, B.C., DeBruine, L.M., Flake, J.K. et al. To which world regions does the valence–dominance model of social perception apply?.

    "text": "Research on moral reasoning is centered around moral dilemmas in which deontological perspectives (emphasizing individual rights) are in conflict with consequentialist reasoning (also referred to as utilitarian; following the greater good). A central finding of this field is that people in certain situations are more likely do go with deontological considerations, while in other cases they are more likely to decide based on consequentialist reasons. In their seminal article, Greene et al. (2009) tried to investigate the effect of situational and psychological factors (e.g., intent of the agent, or physical contact between the agent and victim) on people’s moral decisions, but their work could not explore the effect of a potentially important component: culture. Therefore, the goal of the present research proposal is to empirically test the universality of utilitarian and deontological responding by directly replicating Greene et al.’s experiments on non-WEIRD samples as well as to explore the influence of culture and economic status on moral reasoning.\nBago, B., Kovacs, M., Protzko, J. et al. Situational factors shape moral judgements in the trolley dilemma in Eastern, Southern and Western countries in a culturally diverse sample.

It also provides an opportunity to test theories about risk communication. As part of a larger Psychological Science Accelerator COVID-19 Rapid Project, a global consortium of researchers will experimentally test competing hypotheses regarding the effects of framing messages in terms of losses versus gains. We will examine effects on three primary outcomes: intentions to adhere to policies designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19, opinions about such policies, and the likelihood that participants seek additional policy information. Whereas research on negativity bias and loss aversion predicts that loss-framing will have greater impact, research on encouraging the adoption of protective health behaviour suggests the opposite (i.e., gain-framing will be more persuasive). We will also assess effects on experienced anxiety. Given the potentially low cost and the scalable nature of framing interventions, results could be valuable to health organizations, policymakers, and news sources globally.\nWang, K., Goldenberg, A., Dorison, C., Miller, J.

The same is true for some social groups as well–when asked to imagine a Black or White person, people tend to imagine a Black or White man (Schug, Alt, & Klauer, 2015). One reason for this is androcentrism: the belief that men are the default and women the exception or “other” (Bailey, LaFrance, & Dovidio, 2018; Bem, 1993; Smith & Zarate, 1992).The present research will use a global distributed laboratory network to describe the gendered nature of prejudice against seven social categories (i.e., Black people, East Asian people, White people, police, politicians, and criminals). We hypothesize that if a prejudice occurs for the group it is more strongly related to prejudice of the men of that social category.

    "text": "According to the Justified True Belief (JTB) account of knowledge, a person’s ability to know something is defined by having a belief that is both justified and true (i.e., knowledge is justified true belief). However, this account fails to consider the role of luck. In 1963, Gettier argued that JTB is insufficient because it does not account for certain situations, called Gettier cases, wherein a person is justified for believing something true but only because of luck. It is unclear whether lay people’s intuitions about knowledge lead them to agree with Gettier, such that lay people believe that individuals in these cases lack knowledge (referred to as Gettier intuitions). We attempt to provide a robust estimate of the Gettier intuition effect size by replicating Turri and colleagues’ (2015) Experiment 1. The Collaboration Replications and Education Project (CREP) selected this study for replication based on its undergraduate appeal, feasibility, and pedagogical value. However, in light of some inconsistent results, suboptimal designs, and inconsistent evidence for cultural variation (e.g., Machery et al., 2015; Nagel, et al., 2013; Seyedsayamdost et al., 2015; Starman & Friedman, 2012; Weinberg et al., 2001), the improved methodology of Turri et al. (2015) make it an important study to replicate cross-culturally. Therefore, we propose a multisite Collaboration preregistered replication of Turri and colleague’s (2015) Experiment 1 (35 labs from 14 countries across 4 continents signed up at time of submission; expected minimum N = 1,500). Results of this study are expected to provide a clearer picture of the Gettier intuition effect size, lay people’s theory and practice of knowledge, and potentially cross-cultural similarities and differences.\nHall, B.

    "text": "According to stereotype threat theory, the possibility of confirming a negative stereotype provokes feelings of threat, leading people to underperform on the very tasks on which they are stereotyped. This theory has immense theoretical and practical implications, but many studies supporting it suffer from small samples and varying operational definitions of stereotype threat. For the first problem, we propose to leverage the Psychological Science Accelerator’s vast network of US-based labs to recruit a large sample of African American students to participate in a test of stereotype threat theory. For the second problem, we propose to use an adaptive design to find, among four procedures each to increase and reduce stereotype threat, the comparison that provides the best evidence for an effect. By assessing the robustness of a socially and scientifically important theory with a rare population, this proposal will advance both psychological science and the Accelerator’s core mission.\nForscher, P.

However, the evidence for mental simulations of object orientation is limited. We report a study that investigates the match advantage of object orientation across speakers of different languages. This multi-laboratory project aims to achieve two objectives. First, we examine the replicability of the match advantage of object orientation across multiple languages and laboratories. Second, we will use a mental rotation task to measure participants’ mental imagery after the sentence-picture verification task. The relationship between the participants’ performance of the two tasks will provide a cross-linguistic examination of perceptual simulation processes. With the (broad) evaluation of individual mental imagery ability and potential linguistic moderators, we expect a robust estimation of match advantage of object orientation.\nChen, S., Szabelska, A., Chartier, C.

    "section": "Study Incubation",
    "text": "Study Incubation\nUnlike previous PSA calls, this call includes the option of submitting a short initial proposal that will be considered for study incubation. See section below for requirements.\nThe intention of incubation is to support proposing authors in developing a full proposal. This extra step is designed to remove barriers to submission and increase the competitiveness of proposals from researchers who are under-represented in psychological science (broadly defined and self-identified). \nAuthors of all initial proposals will be given written feedback and the opportunity to meet with someone from the grant team to discuss their projects. A subset of these proposals will also be selected for further incubation. Proposing authors of these submissions will be provided additional guidance in the form of meetings, full proposal draft feedback, and ad hoc support.\nShort proposals may be submitted at any point up until February 15, 2023, and will be evaluated on a rolling basis for feedback and support needs."

    "section": "Proposal Selection",
    "text": "Proposal Selection\nAll full proposals, regardless of whether they were a part of study incubation, will have the same requirements and will be given equal consideration during the project selection process.\nPSA projects are selected using a rigorous review process. Researchers submit detailed proposals for consideration. These proposals resemble Stage 1 Registered Reports (e.g., Chambers, 2013), and contain a theoretical introduction and hypothesis, a description of the planned sample and methods, and an analysis plan to test those hypotheses (see below section for requirements).\nThe proposals then undergo several rounds of review, overseen by the PSA’s Study Selection Committee (SSC). First, each proposal is screened for feasibility given the PSA’s current capacity and resources (Initial feasibility and quality review). For instance, a proposal that requires dozens of collection sites with fMRI machines is likely to be rejected based on infeasibility. Simultaneously, the SSC screens out submissions deemed low quality. Proposals that pass this screening are then sent out for peer review (Reviewer identification & review submission). Each proposal is reviewed by 5-10 reviewers, consisting of both PSA members and external experts. These reviewers are identified based on their ethical, methodological, and/or theoretical expertise related to a given proposal. All submissions are also rated quantitatively by members of the PSA network (Network rating). The SSC then synthesizes the reviewer and network feedback to select projects for the PSA to pursue (Study selection decision). See Evaluation Criteria section for more details and anticipated timeline."

Each study will be supported by $40,000 of direct funding for data collection. Specifically, these funds will be distributed to network data collection teams, primarily for the purposes of compensating participants from their local communities.\nThe proposing author teams will also be collectively supported by 3 full-time scientific staff members (a Research Coordinator [Erin Seivers], a Postdoctoral Researcher [Dr. Priya Silverstein], and a Research Scientist [Dr. Kathleen Schmidt]), an additional ⅓ time senior staff member (Dr. Christopher R. Chartier), a ½ time staff member equivalent team of undergraduate research assistants, several members of PSA committees (at their discretion), and members of the network at large (at their discretion)."

    "section": "Submission Requirements",
    "text": "Submission Requirements\n\nInitial Proposals (Optional – these will be considered for incubation)\nInitial proposals should be 500-1000 words in length and include rationale for the project and an overview of the research design. As part of the submission form, proposing authors will provide details about their research including type, investigation category, relevant JTF priority/ies, and subfield. They will also be asked to describe how the additional support provided by the study incubation process would help them overcome barriers to submitting a full proposal or otherwise benefit their submission.\n\n\nFull Proposals (Required)\nThe following manuscript components are required for all full proposals:\n\nCover Page, including the title of the study, date of the latest draft, and keywords\nAbstract of up to 150 words\nMain body submission text of up to 5,000 words\nA version of the submission with a cover page included\nA masked version of the submission without the cover page\nReferences\nSupplementary materials\n\nThe following guidelines are intended to assist you in the preparation of your proposal submission to the PSA. Submissions typically include a description of the key background literature and motivation for the study, hypotheses, study procedures, proposed statistical analysis plan, a statistical power analysis, and pilot data (wherever applicable).\n\nIntroduction\nA review of the relevant literature that motivates the research question and a full description of the study aims and hypotheses. Method\nA full description of proposed sample characteristics, including criteria for data inclusion and exclusion (e.g., outlier extraction). Procedures for objectively defining exclusion criteria caused by technical errors or for any other reasons must be specified, including details of how and under what conditions data would be replaced.\nA description of study procedures in sufficient detail to allow another researcher to repeat the methodology exactly, without requiring further information.\n\n\nAnalysis Plan\nProposed analysis pipeline, including all preprocessing steps, and a precise description of all planned analyses, including appropriate correction for multiple comparisons. Specify all covariates or regressors. Specify analysis decisions that are contingent on the outcome of prior analyses.\nStudies involving frequentist inference must include a statistical power analysis. Estimated effect sizes should be justified with reference to the existing literature or theory. Because publication bias inflates published estimates of effect size, power analysis should be based on the lowest available or meaningful estimate of the effect size.\nIn the case of highly uncertain effect sizes, variable sample size and interim data analysis is permissible but with inspection points stated in advance, appropriate Type I error correction for ‘peeking’ employed, and a final stopping rule for data collection outlined.\nFor studies involving analyses with Bayes factors, the predictions of the theory must be specified so that a Bayes factor can be calculated. Authors should indicate what distribution will be used to represent the predictions of the theory and how its parameters will be specified.\nFull descriptions must be provided of any outcome-neutral criteria that must be met for successful testing of the stated hypotheses. Such quality checks might include the absence of floor or ceiling effects in data distributions, positive controls, or other quality checks that are orthogonal to the experimental hypotheses.\n\n\nSupplemental Materials\nInclude full questionnaires, stimuli, and materials needed to conduct the study. Pilot data can be included to establish proof of concept, effect size estimations, or feasibility of proposed methods. Simulated data and analysis scripts are recommended to provide clarity about the exclusion criteria and analysis plan.\nPlease also describe within the supplemental materials the details of what open research practices will be followed and how. This section should include information about plans for data sharing, analysis code sharing, pre-print use, and Registered Report manuscript submission and/or pre-registration. Other practices which are common in PSA studies are open materials, use of open source tools, and open research workflows. \nThese guidelines were adapted from https://osf.io/pukzy."

    "section": "Evaluation Criteria",
    "text": "Evaluation Criteria\nWe anticipate that three studies will be selected and implemented through this call.\nAppropriateness for this special call for studies is one of the key criteria for evaluation. Your full proposal should clearly state how your project aligns with the goals of the call and discuss why your research topic would specifically benefit from global data collection (e.g., theoretical reasons to predict global variation).\nUpon submission of your full proposal, you will be asked to provide details about your project to categorize the submission and help the study selection committee assess its fit and feasibility. These items are listed below (see also the submission form link).\n\nWhat type of research are you proposing?\nWhat category of investigation is your project?\nTo which JTF strategic priority does your research relate? Select all that apply.\nWhat area of psychology best describes the research?\nTarget number of data collection sites\nTarget number of participants per data collection sites\nDoes your project require specialized equipment (e.g., eye-tracking, EEG) or proprietary experimental software (e.g., E-Prime) to be used at the data collection sites?\n\nIf yes: Please explain and justify the use of specialized equipment or proprietary software in your research. Can you provide the collection sites with these resources? Do you only need a minority of sites to participate who already have these resources?\n\nCan experimental materials and analysis scripts for your project be easily shared and made publicly available?\n\nIf no: Please explain and justify why your materials or analysis scripts cannot be publicly shared.\n\nDoes your project require “hard-to reach” samples (e.g., children, traditionally marginalized group members, clinical populations, etc.)?\n\nIf yes: Please explain and justify your use of “hard to reach” samples in your research. Do you only need a minority of sites to participate who already have access to these populations? If not, how will they recruit participants? Does research with this population involve additional ethical considerations?\n\nDoes the study expose participants to more risk than they would encounter in everyday life?\n\nIf yes: Please explain and justify the potential risk to individuals who participate in your proposed study.\n\n\nIn evaluating submissions for this special call for studies, we will prioritize projects whose designs are most well suited for promoting generalizability. In particular, we will prioritize studies that seek global samples (as opposed to studies that wish to sample from one or a few countries), studies with very high statistical power, and studies that are more strongly grounded in previous research (such as replication and generalization studies). All of these criteria are intended to maximize our chances of producing generalizable insights on phenomena-of-interest.\nIn addition, we will evaluate proposals for this special call together so that we can ensure variation across the projects. In particular, we will strive to select a package of studies that, collectively, represent a range of JTF priorities, study designs (e.g., experimental vs. correlational), and researcher backgrounds (e.g., research specialty, researcher location, etc.). This way, we will avoid overrepresenting a given topic, type of research, or type of researcher in this initiative."
