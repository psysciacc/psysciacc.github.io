    "text": "Research projects completed by the PSA are typically selected from a pool of masked protocols submitted in response to an open call for proposals.\nOur most recent call for proposals, Second Special Call for Studies – Studying Generalizability with Global Samples, was released in December 2022 with a deadline of May 15, 2023. We do not currently have an open calls for submissions, but below is more information about what the process typically looks like.\n\n\nThe PSA occasionally releases general calls for studies from all areas of psychology. Proposed projects may be confirmatory or exploratory, test a novel research question or propose a replication, or explore the validity of measures or stimuli. When project proposals are submitted for consideration, authors are asked to explicitly address feasibility, implementation, and ethics concerns. Non-members can submit proposals, but must join the PSA if the project is selected.\nPSA projects are selected using a rigorous review process. Researchers submit detailed proposals for consideration. These proposals resemble Stage 1 Registered Reports (e.g., Chambers, 2013), and contain a theoretical introduction and hypothesis, a description of the planned sample and methods, and an analysis plan to test those hypotheses.\nThe proposals then undergo several rounds of review, overseen by the PSA’s Study Selection Committee (SSC). First, each proposal is screened for feasibility given the PSA’s current capacity and resources. Simultaneously, the SSC screens out submissions deemed low quality. Proposals that pass this screening are then sent out for peer review. Each proposal is reviewed by 5-10 reviewers, consisting of both PSA members and external experts. These reviewers are identified based on their ethical, methodological, and/or theoretical expertise related to a given proposal. All submissions are also rated quantitatively by members of the PSA network. The SSC then synthesizes the reviewer and network feedback to select projects for the PSA to pursue.\n\n\n\nSpecial calls for studies have specific requirements in addition to those of general calls. These may include stipulations about the research topic, design, or population of interest. See the Second Special Call for Studies – Studying Generalizability with Global Samples for example. Any differences from the standard study selection procedure summarized above are detailed in the call.\n\n\n\nIn some instances, researchers might benefit from a formal and flexible affiliation with the PSA. Affiliated projects are not guaranteed the direct support received by standard projects but are formally recognized and promoted by the network.\nThe Affiliated Projects policy document and submission form are in development are here."

In 2020 and 2021, this conference was called PSA-CON and largely focused on projects conducted by members of the PSA.\nBy 2022, it was clear that big team science had proliferated far beyond our community. Thus, we did what we do best: collaborated! Working with the ManyBabies and ManyPrimates consortia, we re-focused the conference on all things big team science and gave it a new name: the Big Team Science Conference (BTS-CON). The inaugural 2022 BTS-CON had over 450 registrants and 50 sessions. With continued support, we hope that this conference will continue to be an inaugural event where people can come together to discuss the challenges, benefits, successes, and future directions of big team science.\nInterested in attending the next BTS-CON?

    "text": "Study updates:\n\nPSA-002: Object Orientation & PSA-003: Gendered Prejudice-. PSA-002 & -003 are finishing up data collection for English-speaking labs this month. We anticipate finishing data collection for non-English speaking labs by the end of May and will draft the Stage 2 report shortly afterward.\nPSA-004: Accelerated CREP- 004 has completely finished data collection! The leadership team and other volunteers have begun the process of data processing, pre-processing work, and working on final reviews for finished labs.\nPSA-005: Stereotype Threat- We are waiting on vaccine distribution to get to a place that allows in-person data collection again. This summer, we will evaluate whether in-person data collection is likely to be feasible in Fall 2021.\nPSA-006: Trolley Problem- This project is coming close to an end as we have submitted the manuscript! Now we are waiting to hear more from the reviewers.\nPSA-007: SPAM-L- The 007 Canvas Website is in use. We have rolled out the three pre-projects and have had several people already contribute so far!! If you would like to contribute to the pre-projects, please email Erin Buchanan (buchananlab@gmail.com).\nPSA-COVID Rapid Bundle (001/002/003)- PSACR is now focused on getting manuscripts written, revised, and submitted. PSACR-001 is revising their manuscript based on team feedback. PSACR-002 has been accepted with minor revisions at Nature Human Behavior, and all co-authors are reviewing the submission and updating their authorship information over the next 10 days. PSACR-003 is revising their manuscript based on team feedback. Erin Buchannan is also drafting a data paper that describes the method of the bundled project. Once this manuscript is ready, we will share the draft with the entire PSACR team (i.e., all data collection labs, translators, etc.), who are invited to serve as co-authors.\n\n\nA note from the amazing Charlie Ebersole (former Interim Director)\nOver the last few months, I got to see the PSA from a new perspective, serving as its interim director. I came into this role through a very competitive process among the Associate Directors - that being that I was the only one who wasn’t currently teaching and/or raising very small children. In hindsight, though, I’m incredibly grateful for this somewhat random opportunity. I gained a lot from this experience, but what I will take most from it is hope. I am more hopeful than I have been in some time for psychological research, researchers, and our ability to maybe make the world a bit better. That’s because of you all.\nThe greatest strength of the PSA is our collective knowledge and effort. I knew that before I served as director. However, I didn’t realize just how strong we were as a network. The PSA is filled with more smart, talented, hard-working people that actually want to improve things than I had ever gotten to see before. It is genuinely inspiring. There is more knowledge and experience in this group than I could ever hope to acquire in a career, and I’m thankful that I got to learn from more of you over the last few months.\nThere are a lot of issues that the PSA will continue to grapple with. We’ve struggled to live up to some of our values in terms of global representativeness at all levels of the organization. Finding funding continues to be difficult. However, I feel very confident that we’ll be able to overcome the challenges we face and continue to build a stronger, more impactful, and more inclusive network. That confidence comes from working with you all. You are an incredible group of scholars and humans. It was my honor to serve as director of such a great collection of people.\nThanks everyone, Charlie\n\n\nElections for Director and Associate Director:\nWe are pleased to announce that the most recent PSA election has come to its conclusion. With 187 completed ballots cast, the PSA expressed confidence in Nicholas Coles (@coles_nicholas_) to serve as director, and selected Erin Buchanan (@aggieerin) and Lisa DeBruine (@LisaDeBruine) to serve as Associate Directors. All three have accepted the positions and will start Friday, April 23. Congratulations and THANK YOU, Nicholas, Erin, and Lisa.\nIt is always tough when there are many more wonderful candidates than there are positions to fill. As we collectively wish Nicholas, Erin, and Lisa well in their new roles, let's also offer our thanks and kudos to all the candidates for their willingness to throw their hats into the ring. I’m sure I’m not alone in appreciating the great ideas and thoughts that went into the statements and conversations on Slack. THANK YOU, Hans Rocha IJzerman (@hansijzerman), Jessica Flake(@JkayFlake), Sandersan (Sandy) Onie (@DrSandersanOnie), Gerit Pfuhl (@Gerit_Pfuhl), and Rima-Maria Rahal (@rimamrahal).\nLet's also please offer our thanks and kudos to our election tellers, Crystal Steltenpohl (@CrystalNSYoung), Ilker Dalgar (@IlkerDalgar), and Max Primbs (@MaxPrimbs). They were on the receiving end of a LOT of emails and did their due diligence to ensure a fair and accurate process. THANK YOU, Crystal, Ilker, and Max.\nWe're all very lucky that we get to work and think with bright people the world over!  \nBest, \nHeather Urry\n\nA special thank you to Heather Urry\nWe also would like to thank the amazing Heather Urry (@HeatherUrry) for coordinating these elections. This was the biggest election process that the PSA has seen so far, and she did a FANTASTIC job coordinating everything. To give you an idea of her contribution to this election, we have listed a few tasks that she worked on during this process (This is not a complete list of her contributions). She managed the nominations, contacted each of the nominations to see if they were still interested, collected and distributed the statements, answered questions about the process, created each candidate's Slack channels, kept the entire network up to date and in the loop, set up the election ballot, and analyzed the election outcome data. So, if you have a moment to send Heather a Slack, direct message, or email, please thank her for her amazing work to make this election happen!\nCommunity Building and Network Expansion\nWe have implemented monthly social events to allow new members to get integrated into our community. Everyone is welcome to join these meetings to get to know other members in our network. Here is the link for each month's meeting! We will post the dates for each month on the PSA gcal. \nIf you want to keep up to date with the various events that are happening on the PSA Network, subscribe to our calendar via Gmail or Outlook, depending on what you use! This should be the link to the calendar.\nAnother initiative the CBNE committee is implementing is Community Energizing threads- informal Slack threads to help members get to know each other better, their works, ideas, approaches, etc. [Similar to the idea of ’themed discussion days' on certain subreddits, if you're familiar with Reddit]. The community building committee thought it was a good time to bring it back! Absolutely all members are welcome to join in. Feel free to make the thread messy, especially if you want to reply to the responses you find to be interesting, or with topics you find similar interests on. We will be posting these periodically so be on the lookout for these threads."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA), a network of 300 labs collaborating to collect large-scale international samples of psychological data, is currently accepting study proposals from all areas of psychological science. Anyone can submit a proposal, whether or not they are a member of the PSA. Our mission is to accelerate the accumulation of reliable and generalizable evidence in psychological science, reducing the distance between truth about human behavior and mental processes and our current understanding. For a full overview of the PSA, please see our pre-print introducing our policies and procedures (https://psyarxiv.com/785qu/).  Proposed studies can test novel hypotheses or focus on the replication of previous findings, can be basic or applied in focus, and can be exploratory or confirmatory in nature. Because accepted studies will likely involve considerable use of resources, the study selection process begins with the preparation and evaluation of a Registered Report style submission by authors hoping to collect data via the PSA network. Our Study Selection Committee will conduct an initial feasibility evaluation for all proposed studies (see below for more information on this feasibility check). Studies that pass this check will be evaluated by 10 peer reviewers and ourStudy Selection Committee for final selection. We plan to accept 2-3 studies during this round of review. Selected studies will then proceed through the PSA workflow depicted in the figure below.  Please email submissions to our Director, Dr. Christopher R. Chartier, cchartie@ashland.edu. Submissions will be accepted until June 20th, 2018."

Although the PSA is comprised of hundreds of labs from around the world who have agreed to volunteer some of their resources to PSA projects, we are currently unable to accommodate all types of designs. Submissions are more likely to pass the initial feasibility check if they have the following characteristics:\n\nDo not require specialized equipment (e.g., eye-tracking, EEG) or proprietary experimental software (e.g., E-Prime) to be used at the data collection sites, unless the proposing team can provide these resources to data collection labs\nExperimental materials and analysis scripts can be shared easily and made publicly available\nDo not require hard-to-reach samples (e.g., clinical populations). We hope to better accommodate such sampling in the future.\nTarget sample size per site is less than 150 participants\nTarget number of data collection sites is less than 150\nDuration of an individual data collection session is less than 90 minutes\nThe likelihood and severity of risk to the participant is kept to a minimum, such that the risk is not greater than what participants would face normally and would not require special consideration or deliberation from an ethics board."

Submissions normally include a description of the key background literature and motivation for the study, hypotheses, study procedures, proposed statistical analysis plan, a statistical power analysis, and pilot data (wherever applicable).\n\nIntroduction\nA review of the relevant literature that motivates the research question and a full description of the study aims and hypotheses.\n\n\nMethods\nA full description of proposed sample characteristics, including criteria for data inclusion and exclusion (e.g. outlier extraction). Procedures for objectively defining exclusion criteria due to technical errors or for any other reasons must be specified, including details of how and under what conditions data would be replaced. A description of study procedures in sufficient detail to allow another researcher to repeat the methodology exactly, without requiring further information. Proposed analysis pipeline, including all preprocessing steps, and a precise description of all planned analyses, including appropriate correction for multiple comparisons. Specify all covariates or regressors. Specify analysis decisions that are contingent on the outcome of prior analyses.\n\n\nResults\nStudies involving Neyman-Pearson inference must include a statistical power analysis. Estimated effect sizes should be justified with reference to the existing literature or theory. Since publication bias overinflates published estimates of effect size, power analysis should be based on the lowest available or meaningful estimate of the effect size. In the case of highly uncertain effect sizes, a variable sample size and interim data analysis is permissible but with inspection points stated in advance, appropriate Type I error correction for ‘peeking’ employed, and a final stopping rule for data collection outlined. For studies involving analyses with Bayes factors, the predictions of the theory must be specified so that a Bayes factor can be calculated. Authors should indicate what distribution will be used to represent the predictions of the theory and how its parameters will be specified. Full descriptions must be provided of any outcome-neutral criteria that must be met for successful testing of the stated hypotheses. Such quality checks might include the absence of floor or ceiling effects in data distributions, positive controls, or other quality checks that are orthogonal to the experimental hypotheses.\n\n\nSupplemental Materials\nInclude full questionnaires, stimuli, and materials needed to conduct the study. Pilot data can be included to establish proof of concept, effect size estimations, or feasibility of proposed methods. Simulated data and analysis scripts are ideal for clarity of the exclusion criteria and analysis plan. These guidelines were adapted from https://osf.io/pukzy.\nPlease email submissions to our Director, Dr. Christopher R. Chartier, cchartie@ashland.edu. Submissions will be accepted until June 20th, 2018."

Each project made big strides.\n\n001 Face Perception: In 2019, we completed the first PSA project (PSA001), which involved 214 authors and 11,481 participants from 11 world regions, and 41 countries. Currently, the Stage 2 Registered Report is under review at Nature Human Behaviour. For this project, we also launched the Secondary Analysis Challenge, which grants 10 awards of $200 to research teams that create and execute a pre-registered re-analysis of the project data. Currently, this secondary challenge has 8 submissions and all have been checked for computational reproducibility.\n002 Object Orientation and 003 Gendered Prejudice: 2019 was a busy year for the 002 & 003 team. We translated our materials into 16 different languages and implemented our procedure across 19 countries. We have completed data collection at 23 different sites, with more sites continuing their data collection into the spring. We hope to have the Stage 2 Registered Report manuscript under review at Psychonomic Bulletin & Review in 2020.\n004 True Belief: The Accelerated CREP collaboration is really picking up steam - 39 teams are collecting data (and more are welcome to join in here -- there is information at the top of the form with helpful links). We plan to wrap up data collection around June and work on the final manuscript shortly thereafter, to be reviewed as a Stage 2 Registered Report at Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science. There are still plenty of opportunities to get involved. Contact jordan.wagge@avila.edu or crep.psych@gmail.com for more information.\n005 Stereotype Threat: In 2019, we drafted the initial submission of our Stage 1 Registered Report for Nature Human Behaviour and received a strong revise and resubmit. We also submitted a revised version of the manuscript and are still waiting to hear back about the revision’s status. Finally, we recruited 27 collaborating labs to join the project, all of whom have secured IRB approval. If you wish to join too, you can read more about the project, and sign up as a collaborator, here.\n006 Moral Thinking: In 2019, this project's team also drafted their initial submission of a Stage 1 Registered Report and submitted it Nature Human Behaviour, received a positive revise and resubmit, submitted a revision, received another small R&R :), and are completing the new round of revisions now. We have 147 labs signed up to collect 18,637 potential participants. Most labs are ready to test the link and collect data! If you are interested in joining, you can sign up by filling out this form. Every lab is welcome, but we are specifically searching for collaborators who could collect data from at least 100 participants in India, South-Korea, Japan, or Thailand. The experiment will be run online, so collaborators can simply have to send out a link, and participants are not required to come to the lab."

These forms will only be open for a week (until midnight on the 20th in the last time zone on earth) to allow quick conclusion of this round of study selection. We think you’ll have fun looking at and evaluating these excellent submissions! We also received a very interesting, but quite atypical submission, that we are collating feedback on. In response to our last call for studies, a research team submitted a proposal that is not so much a specific study, but rather an intriguing way in which we may select and develop a future study. The SSC found that it had promise, but that it didn't fit our typical model for submission review and selection. So, the SSC Assistant Directors decided to pull the submission from the standard review track, and instead begin a PSA-wide conversation to consider and eventually decide by consensus (or perhaps vote) if we should implement the proposal. Members, please provide your initial feedback by joining the conversation currently ongoing in our general Slack channel (scroll up to the thread beginning on November 27th)."

The development of this policy was inspired in part by questions from potential funders as to whether the PSA would be willing to run studies about specific topics. The PSA does not, at present, have guidelines for these decisions. The policy therefore also seeks to lay out these guidelines. You can find a draft of the policy here."

Please email crep.psych@gmail.com.\nThank you\n-The CREP & PSA teams\n\n\nElections For Director and Associate Director: \nThe PSA is currently in the process of electing a new Director and one Associate Director. These positions will be filled by a direct election from the PSA network. PSA leadership has received all of the nominations (self or others) for these roles and we plan to conduct the election process over the next two months. Each nominated individual has until March 15 to write a 1000 word statements to support their candidacy. Shortly after March 15, we will make the candidate statements available in the PSA Slack.  If you have any questions about the election process or what’s involved in the positions, contact Heather Urry, at heather.urry@tufts.edu.\nAppointments:\nWe have 4 new assistant directors appointed. We are very excited to see what each of them will bring to the table. \nMiguel Silan - Assistant Director of Community Building and Network Expansion\nMiguel Silan is a psychological science researcher with a focus on meta-methodology (how do we know what we know and why do we do what we do?). He is studying issues in ontology, philosophy of psychometrics and the nature of fuzzy constructs. With the PSA he is scrutinizing the vulnerabilities of cross-cultural studies, and consequently, rethinking the possibilities in how to approach multi-site studies and other large-scale collaborations.\nAs assistant director for the CBNEC, he plans for the committee to have a more purposive and systematic community expansion approach – especially in recruiting from developing countries and underrepresented world regions. Further, with CBNEC, he is looking forward to implementing a roster of community engagement events (including our beloved coffee socials), as well as community assessment to aid in sustainably applying initiatives from other committees (ex. financial schemes).\nMaximilian Primbs - Assistant Director of Translation and Cultural Diversity\nMaximilian is a second year Research Master student in Behavioural Science at Radboud University, the Netherlands. After learning about the PSA through an interview he conducted with Chuan-Peng Hu, Max joined the PSA as language-wise coordinator for German for PSA006. After a very positive experience with 006, he decided to work on the PSACR project series and ended up coordinating the translation process for the project. In his term as Assistant Director of Translation and Cultural Diversity he wants to focus on standardising the PSA translation process by creating standard templates and implementation workflows. Moreover, he wants to increase the cultural diversity of the PSA by recruiting students to work on PSA projects. His work outside the PSA is focussed on stereotypes, visual perception, and on the analysis of reaction time data. In his free time, he enjoys fitness, boxing, and playing Dungeon and Dragons (the first two pre-lockdown ).\nBiljana Gjoneska - Assistant Director of Ethics\n\n\n“I discovered the world of PSA, when I first learned about a multinational study investigating morality across the world (PSA 006). The deontological and utilitarian principles explored in different moral dilemmas across many countries, were evocative of medical ethics principles acquired over the course of my undergraduate studies:”primum nil nocere” (i.e., “first, do not harm”) and “primum optime curare” (i.e., “first, secure optimal treatment”). So, I was instantly drawn to the world of PSA.\nI discovered the core PSA principles, when I attended the first conference (PSACON). This is where I realized that the topics discussed and the idea I was presenting (about a public auction of proposals) were all grounded on the same principles: scientific rigor and openness to criticism, transparency and decentralized authority, diversity and inclusion. The most humane and most basic ethics was at the root of them all.\nI discovered the PSA community, when I was closely collaborating on a chapter about PSA (as promising resource for clinical psychologists). I realized that some moral foundations that I studied over the course of my doctorate studies, like fairness and reciprocity, care and sharing, were the shared characteristics of all my colleagues and PSA members. \nThe PSA Ethics Committee comes as a next logical step. I can’t hardly wait to embark on this journey, and I promise to hold all of the mentioned principles and to cherish all people and opinions.” \n\n\nJessica Flake - Assistant Director of Methods\nJK Flake has been an active member of the PSA from the beginning. She worked with Chris Chartier and Patrick Forscher to develop a data and methods committee for the PSA and was the methodologist for PSA001. Her work with the data and methods committee has focused on ensuring methodological rigor of PSA studies and making the PSA an avenue for contributing methodological innovations to the field of psychology. Currently she is leading the PSA’s first ever large-scale measurement invariance study and working with the data and methods committee to further our metascience research and support of accepted studies with methodologists."

    "text": "We are excited to announce that we have selected our first study to be conducted with the Psychological Science Accelerator distributed laboratory network. Ben Jones and Lisa DeBruine of the University of Glasgow (http://facelab.org/) submitted an excellent proposal to test if Oosterhof and Todorov's (2008) valence-dominance model of social perception generalizes across world regions. In their submission they explain, \"Oosterhof and Todorov (2008 PNAS) found that Principal Component Analysis of trait ratings of face images made by students at a US university produced two components. The first component, which they labeled ‘valence’, was highly correlated with rated trustworthiness. The second, which they labeled ‘dominance’, was highly correlated with rated dominance. Although this two-component model of social judgments of faces has become very influential, the extent to which it applies to trait ratings of faces made in other regions of the world is not yet known. The proposed project would use confirmatory factor analysis to establish whether the model described in Oosterhof and Todorov (2008 PNAS) can (1) be replicated in a new sample of North American raters and (2) can also explains trait-ratings made in other world regions (United Nations Country Grouping: Africa, Asia, Central America, Eastern Europe, European Union, Middle East, North America, Oceania, South America, The Caribbean).\"  Their blinded submission was reviewed by over 40 members of the Psychological Science Accelerator. Our Study Selection Committee found it feasible for our initial efforts, our Advisory Committees noted many strengths of the submission and the likely impact of such a study, and we ultimately decided it was an excellent study to kick-off the Accelerator! In the coming days and weeks, all experimental materials, protocols, translated instructions, and analysis scripts will be finalized in a collaborative effort between the proposing authors and our committee members. We look forward to subsequently matching laboratories from our network with this exciting project. While we will invest considerable data collection in this study, it will not come close to exhausting the overall data collection capacity of the Psychological Science Accelerator for 2018. Thus, we continue to review the other excellent and exciting submissions that we received following our first call for studies. More announcements will be coming soon! If you would like to join the Psychological Science Accelerator, to assist in data collection for this specific study, or to be involved going forward, please sign up here to receive more information!"

    "title": "Recognizing Invisible Labor in the PSA",
    "section": "",
    "text": "One of the biggest threats to the sustainability of large-scale collaborations is the rewards system in place for scholarly labor. Scholarly labor is rewarded with credit for scholarly products. Typically, people scan authorship lists to observe whom to credit, with the lion’s share going to the first- and last-listed authors. This disproportionate assignment of credit serves as a disincentive for collaborating on papers with author lists that are too long: if the bulk of the credit goes to the first and last authors, middle authorship is only worthwhile when earned through a minimal investment of effort. This disincentive weighs especially heavily on multi-site projects, which require dozens, if not hundreds, of people to pull off successfully. The problem is still harder in a standing organization like the PSA. Maintaining an organization requires a lot of administrative labor – labor that is often invisible if there aren’t mechanisms in place to surface it. In academia, we see this invisible labor problem on a small scale in the typical treatment of academic lab managers: these people are necessary to produce the science that graces academic journals, but are seldom, if ever, properly credited. Given that the success of the PSA depends on ongoing administrative labor, we would like to find ways to disrupt the perverse incentive structure that inhibits standing collaborations in academia. The PSA already endorses a contributorship model of awarding credit for scholarly products and uses the CRediT taxonomy to show project contributions. We will also be unveiling the results of some ongoing initiatives to implement CRediT when we share the results of our first study. One additional initiative that we’ve started is to award stipends for the administrative roles that people fill for PSA studies. For now, we will only be giving six of these stipends, and the stipends themselves are relatively small – $400 – but, if we are able to secure regular sources of funding for the PSA, paying our staff is one of our highest priorities. You can help us increase the size and number of these stipends by donating to our Patreon (and you can read more about our ongoing Patreon campaign here). Finally, we want to make some of the invisible contributions to the PSA more visible by highlighting some of the contributors. Below, we profile five of these people, each at a different place in their scientific career, all of whom have made outstanding contributions to the PSA and its projects. Only by recognizing the value of contributions like theirs will we subvert the system that heaps credit on the few at the expense of the many. Profiles of five major contributors to the PSA Nicholas Coles Nicholas Coles is a fifth year Social Psychology PhD student at the University of Tennessee. He’s a member of both the Project Monitoring and Community Building committees at the PSA.  Nick has been a rockstar Project Monitor for PSA001 (face perception). As the first project monitor for any PSA project, he has helped define what project monitors do, and has made a myriad of tracking sheets, and forms, and other materials that have served as templates for similar tools in other PSA projects. As the PSA001 project monitor, Nick has also served as the primary point of contact for an author list of nearly 200 people. Nick’s efforts have helped produce a data collection effort spanning 11,000 participants, 48 countries, and 28 languages. As if that weren’t enough, Nick also developed a web application that displays an interactive map of the PSA network. If you want to find out more about Nick and his work, check out his website. Anna Szabelska Anna finished her PhD in Cognition at Queen’s University Belfast and is looking for her next adventure. She was recently accepted to the NASA Datanauts project, a program that applies data science methods to NASA datasets. This program, along with her work for the PSA, is the coolest thing that’s happened in her professional life.  Anna has been an exceptionally active member of the PSA from the very start. She was a founding member of the Data and Methods Committee and helped draft its bylaws. She has also co-led a project to create a standard psychology dataset format (Psych-DS), which would enable projects ranging from automated meta-analysis to standardized data analysis tools. She has also played a critical role on PSA002 (object orientation), and in that capacity, she has helped define what methodologists do in PSA studies. One of the more interesting outcomes from that work is a novel meta-science initiative – prediction markets to determine how accurate experts are in predicting whether the object orientation effect replicates in a given language. Finally, Anna has shared her enthusiasm for the PSA with anyone who is willing to listen, giving official talks on the PSA for RLadies Dublin, Women Who Code, and Google Women Techmakers, and co-organizing a PSA workshop and unconference. You can find more about Anna (including her CV) at her LinkedIn profile. Jeremy Miller Jeremy Miller is a Professor of Psychology at Willamette University in Salem, OR. Jeremy is on sabbatical and has generously volunteered a chunk of his sabbatical time to working with the PSA.  Jeremy is the Project Monitor for two PSA projects, PSA002 (object orientation) and PSA003 (gendered prejudice), which have been bundled together for the purpose of efficient data collection. Jeremy coordinates communications between the many, many parties involved in pulling off a project involving 49 labs, 16 languages, and two separate projects, with an eye toward ensuring all parties adhere to the PSA’s ever-evolving policies. His effectiveness in this role is informed by his experience as the head of a data collection lab for PSA001 (face perception). Jeremy also serves on the Project Monitor committee, working with Project Monitors across PSA projects to ensure that the PSA uses its resources effectively and efficiently. You can read more about Jeremy and his lab at his lab website. Marton Kovacs Marton is a second-year master's student at Eotvos Lorand University, Hungary and is a huge fan of both the PSA and the broader movement to improve psychological research. He is planning to apply to PhD programs to do meta-scientific research, focusing specifically on ways to increase research efficiency by minimizing human error.  Even though Marton is relatively early in his scientific career, he has played a critical role in swiftly moving the PSA006 (moral dilemmas) from conception to a submitted Registered Report. As Data Manager, he drafted the data management plan that will ensure that the data from more than 130 participating labs are credible, transparently shared, and efficiently collected. He is also helping develop tools that will help solve some of the unique problems that large-scale collaborations face. This includes the problem of properly crediting contributions mentioned in this post: Marton is developing a Shiny app that helps authors create human- and machine-readable contributorship information so that the “invisible contributions” to multi-author projects are made visible. You can find out more about Marton on his website. Sophia Christin Weissgerber Sophia C. Weissgerber recently started a postdoc position in cognitive psychology at the University of Kassel in Germany. She is survey manager for PSA004 (true belief), a partnership with the Collaborative Replication and Education Project (CREP), which uses multi-site replications to provide training and professional growth experiences for students and instructors. Since Sophia is a huge fan of the CREP-project, she likes to expose her 3rd semester students to real-world hands-on research experience, for example replication of Griskevicius et al. (2010).  Sophia performed a feat of programming wizardry for PSA004, implementing an experimental design in the online platform SocSciSurvey for a project involving 54 sites (and counting), as well as 26 countries and 12 languages. Each site requires a unique survey and survey link, so Sophia also does extensive coordination with the participating sites to personalize each survey for each site. This labor is critical for the project’s success. Sophia also enjoys participating in other PSA-projects, e.g. PSA001 (face perception). She is really excited about the PSA community and work (quote: \"super-awesome\") and together with Hans IJzerman, Rick Klein, and Anna van 't Veer, she is currently working on a non-technical primer on how to conduct code review in psychological science. You can read more about Sophia and her work on her website."

If you are interested in becoming a collaborator, or want to learn more about 007 please e-mail 007spaml@gmail.com.\nPSA-COVID Rapid Bundle (001/003)-\n\nPSACR-001 is working on revising the manuscript at Affective Science.\nPSACR-003- The lead author team is working on resolving a difficult conflict between PSA policy and PNAS policy regarding authorship. Authors of this paper were asked about their preference between a few options, and the lead author team is working to find a consensus decision or other way forward.\n\n\n\n\n(Officially) Announcing PSA 008: Minimal and Real Group Biases!\n\nProject Overview\nThe minimal group effect occurs when random assignment to experimentally created and otherwise meaningless social groups is sufficient to create ingroup preference. PSA 008 will examine the cultural prevalence of the minimal group effect and compare bias in favor of minimal group members to ingroup biases based on real groups (i.e., those favoring family and national group members).\nInterested in learning more and (maybe) joining the project? Fill out this survey!\nThe lead team has created an interest survey to gather information about potential data collection sites and create a contact email list. Please complete the survey by February 15 so we can include an estimated number of sites by location in our Stage 1 Registered Report (to be submitted in March).\n\n\n\nJohn Templeton Foundation Hiring Update\nChristopher Chartier has begun the search to hire three full time positions funded by the John Templeton Foundation. The three positions include a Research Scientist, a Post-doctoral Researcher, and a Research Coordinator that will work with the PSA and Chris on a three year project.\nAll positions will begin on July 1, 2022 on a 1-year contract with the potential to renew for up to two additional years through the end of the project on June 30, 2025 and will report directly to me!

This marks the true completion of our first ever study at the PSA.\nPSA 002/003- The 002 and 003 teams are in the final stages of moving our experiments from Open Sesame/Qualtrics to Lab.JS. Thanks to the hard work of Merle Schuckart, we have drafts of the new programs and are in the process of ensuring that the web versions of the studies retain fidelity to the original protocols and troubleshooting the studies. The new version of the experiment should fully integrate both the 002 and 003 procedures into one online protocol, greatly simplifying future data collection.\nPSA 004: Data collection is still going on and will wrap up at the end of the year! We do however need more CREP reviewers as we wrap up this project at the end of the year. CREP reviewers look over each lab’s OSF page to ensure that each lab is performing the study as planned. If you or someone else is interested please have them fill out this form.\nPSA 005: We have finished our latest revision of the stage 1 manuscript based on our communications with the editor. This should be the last revision before stage 1 acceptance. The newest revisions were submitted on Wednesday!!!!\nPSA 006: 006 will continue data collection through the end of 2020. We have collected lots of great data from all of our members and are excited to see this study through to the end.\nPSA 007: PSA’s new project: Semantic Priming Across Many Languages (SPAML) is just getting started. Learn more by checking out the presentation from the conference: click here! The words2manylanguages part of the project is currently recruiting all kinds of help. We are trying to create a repository of datasets to use as our criterion for the modeling section of this project. We downloaded a bunch of them, but we need to clean them up to a consistent format (naming, csv column names synced, etc.). Anyone who’s interested in helping will be given credit via CREDIT (so this task would count + reviewing the paper for authorship). You can email buchananlab@gmail.com. Join slack or email to be kept updated on the two other pre-projects, more announcements on those soon. All three will need to be completed as part of the design for the full 007 project.\nPSACR 001/002/003: Data collection is complete for PSACR 001 and 003, and PSACR 002 data collection is ending on October 23rd.

I have really enjoyed working with Natalia Dutra on this committee, whose goals of diversity, inclusion, and community building in the PSA are close to my heart. Of course, even as a non-assistant director, I will still be involved and support the CBNEC. The director group is so awesome and open to feedback. I don't usually look forward to committee meetings but the all hands meetings are fun and productive and informative. The general PSA meetings remind me of why I got into science. We have an awesome, collaborative community full of talented people from across the globe.\n\n\nWhile I have no control over who takes my place, I really hope folks from non-US/CA/EU areas consider going for the position. Having someone from these geographic regions in a leadership role, especially for this committee, is crucial for PSA's growth and development. I will miss being CBNEC assistant director but I am SO excited about seeing where new leadership can take this committee and the PSA more generally.\n\n\nIf you think you might be even kinda sorta interested in this position, please DM me on Slack or email me at cnsteltenp@usi.edu! I'd love to chat about the group and brainstorm on where it can go from here!"

    "text": "Chris\n \n\nI’ve learnt a phenomenal amount about study design, translations, registered reports, organisation, and quantitative methods through my involvement with the PSA. In particular, I’ve learnt a lot from faculty like Chris Chartier, Jessica Flake, and Hans IJzerman, as well as postdocs and grad students like Bastian Jaeger and Nick Michalak. It’s really reinvigorated my interest in research too.\n\n-Ben Jones\n\nWhen I saw one of the early maps of labs my reaction was, “oooh there are going to be a lot of interesting measurement and modeling challenges” –I sent Chris a message and asked if we could talk. I wanted to know, could there be a methodological research and support arm of the PSA? He said !YES! And I reached out to some other people I had met at SIPS to talk more about forming a methods committee for the PSA. We are still figuring it all out, but every other week a group of us, across at least 3 time zones, get together to discuss the data and methods aspects of the PSA. What started as an interest in stats has morphed into a group of people working to make the PSA an enduring presence in psychology. I feel lucky to have found this family early in my career. It is scary for it to be up to us to make it happen, but also energizing!\n\n-Jess Flake\n\nI still remember that I felt so proud when I could show to my students that Catanzaro - a town located in one of the most impoverished areas in Southern Italy - was on the PSA map. I felt like that for many reasons. One of them is that the bachelor programme in Psychology at the University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro started just two years ago. We are only a few teachers, the most of us at the very beginning of our careers, passionate about our job and willing to provide our students with the most advanced and updated knowledge about what is going on in our field. I dedicated more than one lecture in my Methods class on the importance of reproducibility/replicability and on how Psychology is moving forward, thanks to the spreading of Open Access practices, pre-registration, and the PSA. I hope that my students will feel proud to know that they are not at the margins of this revolution, but rather embrace it and take part in this exciting adventure, which is growing and becoming more and more ambitious every month. Thank you for building it.\n\n-Marco Tullio Liuzza\n\nThe PSA is the most exciting thing I’ve ever been involved with in science. The way so many people (especially so many talented ECRs) came together to pool their expertise and create something much bigger than the sum of its parts has been awe-inspiring. Through my involvement in the first study, I’ve seen first-hand just how much work is put into essential aspects of this project that are often overlooked, like the translations. I really hope the PSA can be a model for transforming how we do psychology to make it a more team-based and rigorous science.\n\n-Lisa de Bruine\n\nAs a HDR Graduate student in psychology, my involvement in the PSA has tremendously increased my knowledge of experimental methods. I have had no previous experience with open science, replication, and registered reports. I believe that open science is the future of research. My involvement has allowed me to learn about open science and registered reports. It has been an exceptional opportunity to be involved with high-quality research and to increase my global research contacts and networks. I would encourage everyone to be involved in this exciting network of researchers.\n\n-Monica Koehn"

    "text": "We are excited to announce that we have selected “A Large-Scale, Multi-Site Examination of Stereotype Threat Across Varying Operationalizations” as our next official PSA study! This proposal was submitted by Patrick S. Forscher (University of Arkansas), Valerie Jones Taylor (Lehigh University), Neil A. Lewis, Jr. (Cornell University), and Daniel Cavagnaro (California State Fullerton). This project will test a core proposition of stereotype threat theory, which predicts that the possibility of confirming a negative stereotype can cause people to underperform on the very tasks on which they are stereotyped. Despite its immense theoretical and practical implications, the studies supporting stereotype threat theory suffer from small samples and varying operational definitions of the focal stereotype threat effect. This project aims to resolve the first problem by leveraging the PSA’s large network of US-based labs to gather a large sample of African American students – larger than would be easily manageable with a single lab’s resources. For the second problem, the project proposes to use an adaptive design to find, among four procedures each to increase and decrease stereotype threat, the comparison that provides the best evidence for a performance difference. You can read more about the selected project at its OSF project page, where we’ve deposited a pdf of the project proposal. If you’re interested in joining the project, fill out this this form, where Patrick, Valerie, Neil, and Dan are already recruiting collaborating labs. Congratulations to Patrick, Valerie, Neil, and Daniel! We can’t wait to work closely with them on this exciting project. [gallery ids=\"334,335,336,337\" type=\"rectangular\"]"

    "text": "The Psychological Science Accelerator is a distributed network of researchers across the behavioral sciences. Great theoretical advances can be made by conducting studies with participants being members of rare populations, but power is necessarily small in single-center investigations (due to the populations being rare). With over 1200 labs from 82 countries on all six populated continents, the PSA has the ability to collect large-sample data from rare populations and advance theory. The PSA is able to contribute to the discovery of generalizable knowledge through a new initiative where researchers may propose a study using a rare population for strong theoretical testing."

    "section": "What is a rare population?",
    "text": "What is a rare population?\nFor this call, rare populations are defined in a broad manner: these include hard-to-reach samples whether because of logistical, geographic, cultural or other reasons. Examples include people extremely high or low on a given trait; people with a specific diagnosis; members of rare minority groups, trauma survivors and other vulnerable populations, and so on. Rare populations (broadly defined) that can be accessed across multiple countries globally are preferred to rare populations that can only be accessed within a specific country/region. This would ensure the engagement of the full PSA network, increased data gathering capabilities of the study and that the results are generalizable and not dependent on the idiosyncrasies of the local data collection."

    "title": "Call for Proposals: PSA Rare Populations",
    "section": "What makes for a strong submission?",
    "text": "What makes for a strong submission?\nA major factor of the proposals will be to use a study design where studying the rare population would contribute to a major theoretical advance, regardless of the outcome of the results. In this line, a broad range of methodologies are welcome, not only experimental/quantitative but also including descriptive, exploratory, mixed-methods and qualitative designs. Strong submissions should also justify the need for the use of the PSA network and resources.\n\nStage 1\nSubmit a 2-page proposal with a supplementary document. The proposal should include rationale for the study, the targeted rare population and the study design (including measures, protocols and data analysis).\nImportantly, the proposal should come with an additional supplementary document that details the steps to be taken for data gathering labs to access the rare population. As applicable, this document may include protocols to “filter” the general population, partnering with relevant local institutions, or any such criteria as to demarcate the population of interest and how to access them. This is important so PSA can review the feasibility of the proposal.\nNote: Rare Populations can be vulnerable and data collection in some countries can pose ethical or legal risk. Please consider this when preparing your submission and be prepared to submit (separate from the 2-page proposal) discussion of any ethical issues from an international, multi-lab perspective.\nStage 1 screening will be conducted blind to authors’ identity by the PSA Rare Populations Working Group with proposals first screened for depth of theoretical advance as well as feasibility.\n\n\nStage 2\nIf the 2-page proposal passes the first round, we will be requesting the proposers to write a more detailed proposal with an introduction and methods section in a format that can be submitted as a Registered Report to a major journal [e.g. here].\nThis longer proposal more fully details the theoretical contributions and methods of the study. Importantly, this should also discuss the specific ethical issues of studying the particular rare population of interest. Potential harms and protocols to mitigate these harms should be discussed.\nReview of Stage 2 Proposals will be conducted blind to the authors’ identity, and will be done by the PSA Rare Populations Working Group and content experts.\n\n\nTimeline\n\nDeadline for the 2-page proposal: April 15, 2022\nAnnouncement for successful proposals: May 6, 2022\nDeadline for the detailed proposal: June 10, 2022\nAnnouncement for any selected proposal: July 7, 2022\n\nInitial 2-page proposal with supplemental steps should be submitted using this Google form here.\nFor general inquiries, email John Protzko (protzko@gmail.com) with the Subject Line: PSA:RP Question."

    "title": "Update on the Accelerated CREP: Registered Replication Report Submission Coming Soon. More Labs Welcome to Join!",
    "section": "",
    "text": "On October 22nd, we will submit a Stage 1 Registered Replication Report (peer review prior to data collection) manuscript to Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science for our Accelerated CREP project, an RRR of Turri, Buckwalter, and Blouw (2015). You can read a preprint of the manuscript here. We welcome public feedback on the manuscript as well as new contributors who would like to join the project prior to our submission. Remember that all CREP projects are partly focused on training students, so we invite teams of graduate or undergraduate students or their supervisors to sign up here!\nTo be included in this Stage 1 submission, contributors will need to sign up, review the manuscript, suggest any necessary edits, commit to data collection for the project in 2019, and approve of the manuscript for submission to AMPPS by October 22nd. While teams can still join after the Stage 1 submission and earn co-authorship on the final manuscript, the more sites we have involved by the Stage 1 submission, the stronger our project will be, and the more likely we are to secure an in principle acceptance! You can also read an updated version of the original blog post announcing the Accelerated CREP project below. Updates appear in bold and italics.\n-The Accelerated CREP Team\n\n\n\nPlato suggested knowledge was “justified true belief.”\n\n\n(updated original post below)\n\nThe Accelerated CREP\nThe Collaborative Replication and Education Project (CREP) and the Psychological Science Accelerator are partnering on a project for the 2018-2019 replication season. The mission of the Accelerator is to accelerate the accumulation of reliable and generalizable evidence in psychological science. The mission of the CREP is to improve undergraduate training through crowdsourced replication. We think these two missions can be pursued in tandem.\nThe CREP (http://osf.io/wfc6u) is a crowdsourced replication project designed for undergraduate researchers. We invite students to replicate a study from a pre-selected list, chosen because they are both highly cited and feasible for undergraduates to complete. Contributors receive CREP approval by demonstrating research transparency at both pre and post data collection stages in order to maximize the value of their replication data for future meta-analyses. Once there are enough samples to draw meaningful conclusions from the data, all contributors are encouraged to collaborate on a research paper. Since launching in 2013, over 350 students have started over 100 replication projects. We have one manuscript in press (Leighton et al. 2018), two more nearing completion (Wagge et al.; Ghelfi et al.), and several more that still need more data, listed here.\nThe Psychological Science Accelerator is a more recent crowdsourced project, and though it is similar to the CREP in many ways, it is also more advanced in development and scope (Moshontz et al., 2018). It is a network of 364 laboratories that democratically select studies and then conduct them on a global scale. The major difference is that the CREP is specifically focused on involving undergraduates in the educational component of replication science, while the Accelerator is primarily focused on accelerating psychological science more generally, though educators can certainly work with undergraduates on all Accelerator projects. The CREP and Accelerator have decided to coordinate a pilot test of an “Accelerated CREP” study. This pilot will evaluate the feasibility of the Accelerator formally adding an undergraduate education component, via the CREP, on a more regular basis. It is also an opportunity for the CREP to extend their contributor pool beyond their historical audience, and complete data collection for one CREP study much more quickly than normal. Among the Accelerator’s over 364 active laboratories, we imagine that a subset of PIs would like to either implement the CREP as part of their research methods courses or work with undergraduate researchers on the Accelerated CREP who would benefit from taking “ownership” of a project and contributing to a large-scale collaboration outside of the typical Accelerator workflow. For this partnership, Accelerator members and one or more undergraduate researchers they supervise, are invited and encouraged to work through the CREP process for a single study between January 1, 2019 and January 1, 2020. While the CREP typically runs studies through the US academic year, doing so in this case would prevent many non-US labs from participating equally. Where possible, we recommend that contributing teams assign a student as the contact person to interact with the CREP Review team, in order for them to experience all aspects of the research experience.\nAfter submitting a Registered Replication Report (RRR) proposal to Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science (AMPPS), we have been invited to submit this collaborative replication of Experiment 1 of Turri, Buckwalter, and Blouw (2015) as a Phase 1 RRR. AMPPS also suggested some methodological changes to broaden the generality of our findings - which we have since incorporated into our protocol. If the Phase 1 RRR is accepted, AMPPS will also call for additional contributors through APS. Here we give an overview of the full process for the first “Accelerated CREP” study, which differs in a few notable ways from the standard operating procedures of the Accelerator and CREP.\n\nPhase 1 (submission and evaluation, complete)\nThe CREP team conducted their normal study selection process for the 2018/2019 academic year (now the 2019 calendar year). Each year, the CREP team selects one to three new studies to add to the list of available studies. They identify the top three or four cited articles in the top journal in nine sub-disciplines, then code those studies for feasibility and potential student interest. This year they selected one new study, Turri, Buckwalter, & Blou (2015), “Knowledge and Luck”, Experiment 1 (https://osf.io/n5b3w/) with a target N = 100 for each local site.\n\n\nPhase 2 (Preparation)\nThe CREP invites Direct (or close) replications from contributors. As such, the protocol should match that of the published article. If AMPPS accepts the Phase 1 RRR manuscript, it will serve as the primary protocol by which contributing labs will design their independent replications. For advanced students, the CREP invites Direct+Plus replications (i.e., direct replications “plus” an extension) which involve the addition of one or more additional independent or dependent variables that are collected after (or independently) of the original study. The Turri et al. study 1 is exciting to replicate because the methods are all available in the publication, and they can be administered via computer. Further, there may be interesting moderator variables that could be tested across multiple labs (e.g., education, perception of luck vs. ability, culture, etc.). **** The CREP asks contributors to create and edit an OSF page (https://osf.io/srh4k/) and provide their materials, ethics approval, and a video of their procedure. For the Accelerated CREP, we hope to recruit undergraduates from 50 or more locations to join the project. We already have 35 institutions signed up to contribute, and we expect more!\n\n\nPhase 3 (Implementation)\nCREP contributors submit their project page for review by the CREP team twice, once before and once after data collection. The pre-data review verifies that the contributor is meeting CREP standards for ethics, materials, and procedure. For the post-data review, the CREP team reviews the presentation of the data and the results to verify the data are useable in the aggregate multilevel analyses. Review teams including two faculty and a student administrative advisor, David Redman, will be led by one of the CREP’s experienced Executive Reviewers, Dr. Jordan Wagge. Faculty on contributing teams will be invited to serve as reviewers on other CREP contributor’s projects in order to ensure high quality replications.\n\n\nPhase 4 (dissemination)\nBecause the CREP is decentralized, the local data sets are posted publicly in order to go through the post-data review. Contributors are encouraged to present their findings at conferences, but the data are collated for the drafting and submitting of a manuscript reporting the combined findings, because no single replication provides definitive results. In contrast to normal CREP procedure, we invite potential authors to indicate their interest in authorship at the beginning rather than the end of the project. Braedon Hall will act as 1st author and the coordinating author for the RRR under the guidance of graduate advisor, and lead executive reviewer, Jordan Wagge. The organizers of this partnership consider this a tentative relationship which we will re-evaluate for possible future implementation. In the meantime, come along and join us as we Accelerate a CREP study. Jon Grahe (CREP Project Leader & Pacific Lutheran University) Christopher R. Chartier (Accelerator Director & Ashland University) Additional pronunciation guidance and derivation from Jon Grahe: “Why CREP rhymes with Grapes” the grape metaphor for replication science When considering a bunch of grapes, all from the same DNA, they represent a wonderful metaphor for replication science. Grapes from the same bunch, or different bunches from the same vine, all share DNA, but they are rarely, if ever, identical. They differ from each other in a number of factors much like replications differ from each other, and from an original study. Because of growing conditions, contextual differences; grapes can differ in size, color, and ripeness. All the same DNA, but still different. In comparison to grapes, replications also differ in size, color, and ripeness. Size is the easiest metaphor to recognize, researchers might have more access or resources to collect data from more participants. Color in research reflects all the diversity in application of a replication, not just diversity of participants and experimenters, but also the time of day, the decorations of the lab, the educational culture on campus, and all the other variables that make research laboratories unique. Finally, ripeness reflects age and experience; certainly applicable in research as replications are conducted by experimenters exploring the task for the first time and by professionals who have completed more studies than they can remember."

    "section": "",
    "text": "We have selected the Psychological Science Accelerator’s second study. Congratulations to Dr. Curtis Phills, University of North Florida, who submitted a very compelling proposal to investigate the degree to which cognitive representations of a host of social categories are gendered. Data collection will begin in early 2018.  One of the strengths of this submission, beyond its intellectual merits, is the fact that it can be administered quite quickly and easily in a range of research settings. It remains possible that this study will be paired with another brief study into a single data collection session. Dr. Phills provided the following background and rationale for his proposed study: “Research related to the intersectional invisibility hypothesis (Purdie-Vaughns & Eibach, 2008) and the gendered nature of race (Carpinella, Chen, Hamilton, & Johnson, 2015; Goff, Thomas, & Jackson, 2008; Johnson, Freeman, & Pauker, 2012; Thomas, Dovidio, & West, 2014) suggest men and women may not be equally represented in the cognitive representations of social categories. Research has found people are more likely to think of a Black man than a Black woman when imagining a Black person (Schug, Alt, & Klauer, 2015) and associate Black men more quickly with Black people than Black women (Thomas et al., 2014). Understanding the extent to which men are overrepresented in the cognitive representations of minority groups is a necessary step in designing effective anti-bias interventions. For example, if Black women are not included in the cognitive representation of Black people then interventions designed to reduce bias against Black people or Black men may not ameliorate bias against Black women. This project is designed to investigate the over-representation of men in the cognitive representations of many social categories (e.g., racial, ethnic, gender, political, and religious categories) around the world. Ultimately, it is hoped that this project will contribute to the design of more effective anti-bias interventions by encouraging researchers to specifically include the women of minority groups--especially for groups in which men are over-represented.” We look forward to working with Dr. Phills to finalize data the data collection protocol and data analysis plan soon!"

    "text": "This month, we have updates on myriad fronts, including but not limited to, a spike in new PSA membership sign-ups, progress on studies PSA 001 through PSA 006, information about our recently launched PSA Covid Rapid Studies, a call for new members on two PSA working groups, and several interesting opportunities to collaborate with other PSA members on research projects.\nMEMBERSHIP\nOur network has officially grown to over 1, 000 members. Welcome new accelerators!! We have no doubts that you will do great things in our network. Just in the last couple months since our last newsletter, we have added hundreds of members. We are stoked to see our network continue to grow.\nSTUDY UPDATES\n\nPSA 001- The Stage 2 Registered Report received a revise-and-resubmit from Nature Human Behaviour. The lead authors have made the requested changes, and the participating labs are currently reviewing the updated manuscript. After the lead authors address those comments, they will resubmit the manuscript.\nPSA 002/003- As a result of the pandemic, face-to-face data collection for the 002/003 bundle has been suspended until further notice. We are currently testing the feasibility of moving the procedure online, in case there are no opportunities for in-person data collection for the remainder of the year. Our goal is to complete data collection and submit 002’s Stage 2 registered report by the end of 2020. Thus far, we have collected data from 2,560 participants across 16 languages!\nPSA 004- The Accelerated CREP originally should have been ending data collection right about now, but has been extended through the end of 2020 because of Coronavirus-related delays. You can still join the project to collect data (onboarding form here)! All data collection can happen online.\nPSA 005- The lead team is working on finishing up its revisions of the Stage 1 Registered Report. Our editor at Nature Human Behaviour asked us to do some pilot testing of our technical implementation of the adaptive algorithm that governs condition assignment. With Erin Buchanan's help, we implemented all aspects of the project in formr and conducted a variety of tests to ensure that the condition assignment changes as appropriate in light of different kinds of evidence. This whole effort went slower than expected due to the outbreak of the coronavirus, but we received an extension from our editor. We've also finished a first draft of our paper revisions and our response to reviewers. We expect to submit the revision within 1-2 weeks.\nPSA 006- The PSA 006 project is currently collecting data. So far, the ~150 participating labs have collected data from 8,450 participants. Following the registered plan, the team is conducting sequential data analyses in three cultural clusters. Further rounds of data collection are expected later this year.\nPSACR 1/2/3- PSA Covid Rapid (PSACR) is three bundled studies running together along with some general questions. PSACR 001 and 003 will be submitted for publication after data collection is complete. PSACR 002 was accepted as a Stage 1 Registered Report at Nature Human Behavior. Data collection is live for all three studies in English, Hungarian, and Dutch and many more languages are in the translation and implementation pipeline. Over 5,000 people have participated so far. Many people have been working hard to pull off this project and in particular, Heather Urry, Max Primbs, and Erin Buchanan have done tremendous work to keep the project afloat, catch errors, and help move translation and implementation along.\nUpcoming New Studies- Resulting  from our 2019 call for studies, 1 proposal has been accepted pending minor revisions, two are being revised and resubmitted with possible acceptance in 2020, and several more are being revised and resubmitted in preparation for future calls for studies.\n\nPSA SERVER PURCHASED\nThanks to a generous donation from Erin Buchanan, we were able to purchase new server equipment to support the increasing complexity and data collection load of our current and future PSA studies! The new server has been blazing fast in our initial tests, and it should be ready for us to start using in earnest soon. This also means we are going to be able to overhaul our  member website to give it a functioning dashboard that will be more effective and user-friendly for members.\nPLANNING THE PSA'S FIRST CONFERENCE\nWe are hoping to host a virtual meeting in 2020 and are exploring possible dates. Our preliminary plan is to hold the conference in September (on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, or on 8th, 9th, and 10th) with sessions spreading across 12 hour each days to help accommodate the vast time zone differences of PSA members. We are hoping to get feedback on which set of days works best for our members (starting on the 1st of September or starting on the 8th of September). We are planning to have a range of session types, including update presentations on current PSA studies, workshops on how to get involved in our studies, study submission tips, as well as presentations on non-PSA research that our members are currently working on. We hope to have further details for y'all soon. Please reach out to slewis16@ashland.edu to give feedback on preferred dates or if you would like to be added to our email list of possible attendees.\nDATA AND METHODS COMMITTEE SEEKS NEW MEMBERS\nThe PSA Data and Methods Committee is seeking a new standing member of our committee. The Data and Methods Committee (DM) is responsible for operation and policy development related to methodology, meta-science, and data management within the PSA. Those interested to join the committee should read our bylaws here: https://osf.io/p65qe/. This position is a two-year commitment, starting in June 2020, with the following responsibilities:\n\nAttend bi-weekly Data and Methods committee meetings\nAssist with the committee’s operation and research responsibilities\nAdvise on matters of committee policy\nVote on research projects and amendments to the committee’s bylaws\nFulfill assigned responsibilities (as delegated by the Assistant Directors)\n\nSome examples of recent work carried out by the committee are:\n\nWriting, revising, and ratifying the analysis plan approval process\nCoordinating with the larger PSA leadership to develop a needs assessment\nSelecting methodological reviewers for proposals\nRecruiting methodologists and data managers for accepted projects\nDeveloping a metascience study submission process\nConducting and contributing to DM research projects undertaken by DM members\n\nWe expect Standing Committee Members will devote approximately 8-16 hours per month of time to their work. These are not set limits and may fluctuate from month to month. Any members of the PSA are eligible to apply. Previous service experience with the PSA is desired but not required. Application materials to submit:\n\nStatement of interest outlining interest in working with the DM and relevant experience (short; max 500 words)\nRelevant documentation that supports the information described in the statement of interest and experience (can be a CV, a personal website, blog, osf page, etc.)\nE.g., If you describe experience managing open data you might want to put on your CV links to OSF pages, or link to a github or blog, that is ok -- submit a CV or other document that provides background for your experience\n\nApplicants who move on to the next step of recruitment will be asked to attend a DM committee meeting so that they can become acquainted with our process and procedures. Review of applications to begin within one week, review rolling until position is filled.  Please send application materials to: dataandmethods@gmail.com.\n****PSA METASCIENCE SUBCOMMITTEE SEEKS NEW MEMBERS\nThe PSA Metascience subcommittee is looking for up to 5 new members to help facilitate Metascience research projects within the PSA.  The role of the subcommittee will be to review proposals on work that uses the PSA to research the process of science, as well as develop policy to support metascience research. Responsibilities of subcommittee members will include reviewing proposals, interfacing with members of the Study Selection, Data and Methods, and Data Management Committees when appropriate, and meeting monthly as a group to review progress.\nIf you’re interested, send your information to Nick Fox: nfox423@gmail.com by Friday May 29th.  Include a short paragraph on why you’d like to join the subcommittee, what you’re looking to get out of being a subcommittee member, and any metascience or methodological research experience you’ve had (it’s not required, but will be helpful for us to try and maximize the diversity of experiences!). \nOTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO COLLABORATE WITH PSA MEMBERS\nAfrican Many Labs\n\nWe are starting the ManyLabs: Africa project, which is a doctoral thesis on the replicability and generalizability of effects across African and Western populations. The project is led by Adeyemi Adetula, currently at Université Grenoble Alpes (France). The project is supervised by Drs. Hans IJzerman, Dana Basnight- Brown and Patrick Forscher. \nWe call for researchers from Africa to serve as collaborators in a pilot study (using the CREP framework for a one-study project) and researchers from Africa, Europe, and North America for the main study (ManyLabs: Africa). As part of this project, we will provide online training / webinar courses on open science access and tools to African researchers. \nCollaborators can earn authorship for data collection, translation, and coordination of their research unit. Other activities could include consultation on study/effects nomination and evaluation.\nInterested researchers can sign up here. For further information, please contact Adeyemi Adetula at adeyemiadetula1@gmail.com.\n\nTwo Opportunities from Balazs Aczel: \n\nBalazs Aczel's lab advertises a collaboration opportunity to find out why people violate lock down. Join the project if you can organize online data collection in your country to extend the multinational datasets. Collaborators are expected to collect data (min 350 pps) from a country with some level of current lock down. More info:  https://tinyurl.com/ConfinementNonadherence\n\n\n\nResearch on how you cope with home-office\n\nOur team would like to explore how researchers cope with working from home now and in general. This is a great opportunity for the research community to change old routines and optimize the time they spend in the office and work from home.\nFrom our survey results, we will create recommendations for institutions on how to support researchers' efficiency and work-life balance regarding their options and condition in remote working. After responding, you can sign up to win a 100 USD Amazon (or your choice) voucher. If your region was in recent lockdown, please share your experience with home-office in this ~4-min anonymous survey. Follow this link to the Survey.\nWe appreciate it if you share this survey with your colleagues. Thank you for your support.\nBalazs Aczel, ELTE, Hungary"

    "text": "This month (our 18th month!) we have made progress on PSA policy documents, our search for funding (don't get too excited...no big news yet), and all 6 of our in-progress studies. Also of note, we're now up to 428 unique labs! Thank you so much for everyone who has gotten involved in the PSA!\n\nPSA Policies\n\nThe membership policy was ratified in our most recent vote and is now official PSA policy. This will lead to slight changes in our onboarding process for the PSA generally and specific PSA studies. In the near future we will distribute a one-time form for those already in our membership roster to affirm the code of conduct and the mission of the PSA (be on the lookout for that!).\nWe now call for final comments and votes on our Personnel, Appointments, and Elections Policy Document. PSA members will receive the draft policy via email and have until March 15th, 2019 to vote.\n\n\n\nUpdates from the Funding Committee\nThe funding committee has been working extremely hard to identify and pursue promising funding opportunities for the PSA. We all owe a big thanks to Neil Lewis Jr., Thuy-vy Nguyen, and Hans IJzerman for their efforts in organizing our funding search and attempts to date. Here are some notable attempts:\n\nWe have requested an NSF grant (under review)\nWe requested a Marie Curie grant (but it was rejected :( )\nIn the Netherlands, we will collaborate with Marcel van Assen to request an Open Competition Grant\nDiego Forero is requesting an internal grant at his University to create a PSA hub\nEU PSA researchers are working on requesting a Synergy Grant. Two centers for this grant have been identified, but we will want to identify two more. Those interested in participating can contact Hans IJzerman.\n\nPSA researchers can identify smaller grant opportunities and contact the funding committee (Neil Lewis and Thuy-Vy Vu) to investigate possibilities. We are always looking for ways to support the PSA and to support PSA members through grants, large and small. Finally, central to our future funding requests is to work on a long-term vision document, detailing what we are able to accomplish with our current support and capacity, but also what we would plan to do with additional support to make an even bigger impact on psychological science. Chris Chartier is taking the lead on this, and will share drafts in the coming months.\n\n\nStudy Updates\nNow that we have 6 studies concurrently in preparation or data collection, some of us are having trouble keeping them straight when discussing their status! So, we've started using 3-digit codes and 2-word titles for our in-progress studies. Here are some mini-updates on all 6 PSA studies:\n\n001 FACE PERCEPTION. The study is now up and running, in at least demo mode, for 22 of our data collection languages. You can test out all versions via these demo links. We have now collected data from 3,497 total raters across 9 world regions and are well on our way to meeting our September target for completing data collection!\n002 OBJECT ORIENTATION & 003 GENDERED PREJUDICE. These two studies are \"bundled\" for a shared data collection session. Now that 002 has an in principle acceptance in hand from Psychonomic Bulletin and Review, we have decided to pursue results-blind review (rather than a registered report) for 003. We have initiated IRB and translation processes for these studies in the hopes of initiating data collection quite soon.\n004 TRUE BELIEF. We are still in the \"revise and resubmit\" process for this study at Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science. We hope to have news of an in principle acceptance to share soon!\n005 STEREOTYPE THREAT. The leadership team for this study has made considerable recent progress on making final design decisions and we will be sharing IRB materials with data collection labs in the coming weeks.\n006 TROLLEY PROBLEM. This study now includes a team of 130 labs across 40 countries! We are hoping to submit as a registered report to Nature Human Behaviour. Our next step is to initiate IRB submission in all data collection labs.\n\n\n\nSpreading the Word\nMembers have presented, or otherwise shared, information about the PSA with wide audiences this month.\n\nHannah Moshontz presented at the SIPS pre-conference session of SPSP in Portland, Oregon. You can see her slides here.\nGianni Ribeiro presented to an open science meetup group at IGDORE in Bali.\nLisa DeBruine gave an excellent interview on the Everything Hertz podcast.\nBen Jones published an article on Psychology Today discussing first impressions and how the PSA is working to make the literature less WEIRD.\nChris Chartier, Nick Coles, and Hans IJzerman published an article on Science Trends calling for more researchers to join us in building up the PSA.\n\n\n\nInteresting Links and Opportunities\nFinally, here are some links to other projects or opportunities that PSA members may find interesting (feel free to pass such links along to Chris for future newsletters):\n\nCall for the \"Money Follows Cooperation\" funding stream in the Netherlands.\nInformation about joining the recently announced DARPA SCORE project..\n\nPSA Facebook PSA Twitter"

This month we have updates from Project Management, Data and Methods, and Ethics.\n\nThe D&M committee has been very active developing their own set of committee specific policies and procedures. Recently, they have1) voted on and passed the section of the D&M bylaws laying out the formal roles on the D&M committee (i.e., what the Assistant Directors do, what the standing committee members do, what ad-hoc members do)(2) revised our data management policy with an eye toward being compliant with the Psych-DS project. our hope is that PSA can promote Psych-DS and be a testing ground for how well it works. hopefully this can help Psych-DS gain traction to be a discipline-wide standard for psychology datasets (3) discussed ways for people to propose meta-science projects through D&M. we've put this on the backburner for the time being until we've solidified more of our policies (4) worked on a formal document to identify the needs of PSA-approved projects (5) worked with community building to start building a database of lab-specific meta-data\nThe Project Management Committee has started to manage several ongoing projects and are in the process of making our policies official. Nick Coles and Chris are now project monitors for the face perception study, Hannah Moshontz is the project monitor for the stereotype threat study, and the committee is working to identify individuals interested in taking on a project management role for the object orientation study, the gendered nature of prejudice study, and the trolley problems study! (Email hmoshontz@gmail.com if you are interested!)\nThe Ethics Committee has drafted ethics review guidelines that we will use during the study selection process and will share them with the PSA network for feedback soon. The Ethics Committee has also begun pairing ethics committee members with each PSA study to serve as a dedicated contributor focused on IRB and ethical issues through the full life-cycle of each project."

    "section": "",
    "text": "On August 26, 2017, Chris Chartier wrote a blog post posing a simple question: what might happen if psychology adopted the collaborative “big science” model seen in physics and built a “CERN for psychological science”? 2018 gave us a glimpse of the answer: a rapidly-expanding network of over 300 psychology labs from over fifty countries. The first year was a flurry of activity as, in quick succession, the PSA accepted four studies and had its first academic paper accepted. The network’s rapid expansion in its first year speaks to the hunger for ambitious solutions to two of the problems that psychology currently faces: lower-than-desired levels of replicability and generalizability of psychological findings. The PSA’s second year has marked the beginnings of a transition from idea to action. The network has continued to expand, now standing at over 500 labs from over 70 countries. We have selected 2 new studies, collected data from over 11,000 participants for our first study, initiated data collection in 3 other studies, received in principle acceptance for 2 registered report manuscripts, and submitted another 2 for stage 1 peer review. This productivity in the selection, preparation, and conduct of our studies was matched by a substantial organizational infrastructure development. PSA members named Assistant Directors to lead the committees that do the bulk of its administrative and coordination work, initiated a project to formalize its study pipeline, drafted a coherent set of policies dictating how the PSA manages and releases its data, made the PSA’s first full-time hire (Patrick Forscher at Université Grenoble Alpes), announced the first round of PSA elections, created a Patreon, submitted several grant proposals, and drafted a vision statement outlining the PSA’s long-term priorities. If the PSA’s first year was focused on growth and excitement, its second year was focused on turning plans into action and establishing sustainability, and we hope our third year is one of securing large-scale funding to more effectively pursue our mission with six key aims:\n\nCollect samples that represent all people\nTrain and support our global network of researchers\nExpand the PSA’s capacity to include more complex behavioral studies\nRelease large-scale data-sets that are maximally informative for secondary re-use\nImprove psychological science through meta-scientific and instructional contributions\nExpand capacity to conduct more, and bigger, studies\n\nBelow we have created a chronological timeline of important events in the PSA.

    "title": "How should we fund the PSA?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Patrick S. Forscher and Hans IJzerman\nNote: This post accompanies three surveys, which are embedded as links in the post’s body. For convenience, you can find direct links to them here.\n\nTranslator survey\nDemand for translation survey\nMembership dues survey\n\n---\nIn our previous post, we argued that the PSA has a grand vision and a budget that cannot easily support it. If the PSA is to fulfill its aspirations, the PSA must increase its funding so that it can support an administrative staff.\nIn this post, we will assume that the PSA wants to fulfill its grand vision. We will therefore explore ways that the PSA could create the funding streams that are necessary to achieve that vision. We will review four options: \n\nGrant funding\nCharitable giving\nFees-for-service\nMembership dues\n\nMost of our energy to date has focused on grant funding and charitable giving. A sustainable funding model will require a mix of all the options so that we can balance their strengths and weaknesses. We can think of the PSA’s funding as a sort of investment portfolio where we devote a percentage of effort to each potential income stream based on the PSA’s financial strategy and risk tolerance.\nIn the remainder of this post, we will evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of all four funding streams. For each funding stream, we will also review the activities that we have already attempted and what else we can do in that category. \nThe post is thorough and therefore long. Here are some big-picture takeaways:\n\nWe have already tried, quite vigorously, to secure grant funding and charitable giving, with modest success\nLarge-dollar grant funding is high-risk, high-reward and likely cannot be counted on to secure the PSA’s financial future; small-dollar grant funding cannot easily support staff\nCharitable giving mostly yields small amounts of money, though donated research assistants could help provide labor for the PSA\nFees-for-service offer some potentially interesting funding streams, including conference organization (continuing the success of PSACON2020) and translation\nMembership dues arguably fit the structure of the PSA best out of all funding streams, though we should think carefully about how to implement these without compromising our value of diversity and inclusion\n\nWe will argue that the PSA should pursue fees-for-service and membership dues, small-dollar grants, and charitable giving. Large-dollar grants should only be pursued in periods when the PSA can tolerate risky funding strategies. Finally, the PSA will need a bookkeeper and Chief Financial Officer to formalize its finances.\n\nGrant-Writing\nGrant-writing involves writing a specific proposal to a formal agency. The agency judges the proposal on its merits and its fit with the agency’s mission and, if the proposal is sufficiently meritorious, issues an award. This is the conventional way that scientists try to fund their work. \nWe argue that grant writing is high effort, high risk, potentially high yield, but with high volatility. Grant-writing thus makes for bad planning long-term. \nStrengths\n\nGrants can be very big. The big granting institutions have a lot of money. For example, one of the grants we wrote in the past three years was for €10 million. This dictum is not always true -- many grants are for amounts closer to €1,000 -- but when grants pay off big they pay off big.\nMany scientists have grant-writing expertise. Because grants are the traditional means through which science is funded, grant-writing expertise is easy to find among the scientific community. This makes grant proposals easier to get off the ground than many other funding activities.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nGrants usually fund projects, not infrastructures. Funding an infrastructure like the PSA requires an ongoing investment, whereas projects complete within a few years. For this reason, granting agencies view projects as lower-risk funding priorities. Most grant mechanisms are therefore project-focused rather than infrastructure-focused.\nGrant-writing is high risk. At the US National Institutes for Health, the US’s largest funder, the overall success rate for its most common grant is 23%. This means that, if the PSA relies exclusively on grant funding, we ought to expect 3 out of every 4 grant proposals to not yield any money. It is hard to build a staffing plan for an organization under such risky conditions.\nGrant-writing is inefficient. Grant-writing requires so much time and energy with such a low probability of paying off that the expected return may not justify the expected time investment. One computational model suggests that these inefficiencies are inherent to any funding scheme structured as a competition between proposals because scientists waste as much or more effort on the proposals as they would gain from the science that the proposals fund.\nThe money is not flexible. The PSA wants to use its money for many things: grants to under-resourced labs, paying staff, funding competitions to make scientific discoveries, and many other things. Grants have strict accounting rules that rule out many or most of these activities.\n\nWhat have we done already?\n\nOne proposal to the European Research Council’s Synergy mechanism. This proposal was project-based and very large (€10 million). Some of the money would have gone directly to the PSA, but making the PSA funding work within the constraints of ERC accounting rules was challenging. Writing this grant took years of preparation, including one month of very intense effort by five PSA members. The proposal was rejected.\nTwo proposals to the US National Science Foundation. Both were somewhat large (~$200K) and may have been able to support PSA staff. Both were rejected.\nTwo proposals to the John T Templeton Foundation. Both proposals are project-based and somewhat large (~$200K). One proposal was rejected and one is in limbo due to Covid-19.\nTwo proposals to the European Research Council’s Marie Curie mechanism. Both proposals were project-based and would have supported postdocs (~€120K). Although the postdocs would not have worked directly for the PSA, some of the proposed work would have indirectly benefited the PSA. Both proposals were rejected.\nOne proposal to Université Grenoble Alpes. This proposal was designed to fund grant-writing for both the PSA and UGA. This proposal was funded and has supported a postdoc at a cost of ~€120K. Although the postdoc officially works for UGA, around half their time is donated to the PSA.\nOne proposal to the Association for Psychological Science. This proposal was for $10,000 USD. All the money had to go toward participant recruitment for the PSACR project. This proposal was funded.\nOne proposal to Amazon. This proposal was small ($1,352 USD) and strictly dedicated to paying for server hosting for PSACR. This proposal was funded.\nOne proposal to the Society for Personality and Social Psychology. This proposal was small ($1,000 USD) and could only be used to support participant recruitment for PSA005. This proposal was funded.\nOne proposal to the Society for Improvement of Psychological Science. This proposal was small ($900 USD) and devoted to offsetting the costs of applying for nonprofit status. This proposal was funded. \n\nThe above grants translate to around $12,862,252 in funds sought and $163,252 received. This demonstrates the risk and volatility in grant funding.\nIn addition to the above activities, PSA leadership has submitted a large number of letters of inquiry and less formal communications seeking funding opportunities. These did not reach the stage of formal proposals.\nWhat else can we do?\nThe PSA has explored most of the available options related to grant funding. Thus far, it has had the most success writing small, focused grants. These can support specific activities, such as participant recruitment, but cannot easily support staff.\nSummary\nGrant-writing for large grants is a high-risk, high-reward activity. Grant-writing for small grants usually requires investment of resources, but also cannot easily fund PSA staff. Grant-writing is also the activity into which the PSA has spent most of its funding energy. The PSA may want to focus its grant-writing activities into smaller, project-focused grants.\n\n\nCharitable giving\nCharitable giving involves contacting individuals to solicit money and other resources. Charitable giving is similar to grant-writing in that some entity gives money to the PSA of their own free will. The method differs from grant-writing in that the giver lacks a structured organization that announces funding guidelines and priorities. \nWe argue that charitable giving is moderate effort, low risk, low to medium yield, and medium volatility. Charitable giving allows for somewhat better planning long-term than does grant-writing.  \nStrengths\n\nAllows direct outreach to supportive members of the community. The PSA has generated a lot of support and goodwill. Direct outreach allows members of the community to express this goodwill in the form of direct financial support. \nUnconstrained by deadlines. Many other financial streams, such as grants, come on tight deadlines. Solicitations of charitable giving can happen at any time.\nThe money is (usually) flexible. Grant funding comes with strict accounting rules. Charitable giving sometimes comes with strings attached, but less often.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDonation amounts are often small. The cost for staff salary runs in the tens of thousands of dollars. Most gifts run in the tens of dollars.\nThe overhead for these gifts is often large. This limitation is linked to the first. In contrast to grants, where a payment from a granting agency only needs to be processed once, in a donation drive, payments need to be processed as many times as you have donors. Sometimes these payment processes need to go through a third party, such as PayPal. This can create substantial overhead in both labor and finances.\n\nWhat have we done already?\n\nSet up a Patreon. At the time of writing, this Patreon collects €200 per month. We have used this money to help fund special projects, such as the PSA001 Secondary Analysis Challenge, data collection for PSA001, PSA006, and PSACR, and other miscellaneous expenses.\nFunding drives. We have conducted at least four funding drives in the past three years. These are usually structured around funding a specific project or activity, such as PSACR, and are often announced via the PSA blog. However, we also conducted a funding drive during the first PSA conference, PSACON2020. It is difficult to estimate precisely how much money these drives have generated, but the sum is likely less than $1000.\nDirect outreach. We have also done direct outreach to specific people who we have thought might be willing and able to donate to the PSA. Usually we have relied on personal networks for these direct solicitations. This process is smoother now that the PSA is an official nonprofit and can therefore accept direct tax-deductible donations.\nSpeaking fee donations. A few members of PSA leadership have donated fees they’ve received to speak about multi-site research. A typical speaking fee is around $200. This source of income generates money, but is hard to scale to the point where it would support full-time staff.\nReceived donations of research assistant time. Once special form of charitable giving is staffing time that is donated from an organization to the PSA. This system allowed the CO-RE Lab, for example, to donate the time of one of its interns to the PSA. This donation enabled, among other things, the creation of the first Study Capacity Report. This system works best when the research assistant or intern can be directly embedded within a PSA supervisory structure.\n\nWhat else can we do?\nThe PSA’s new status as a pending nonprofit gives it more options that fit under charitable giving. The option to accept donated time from research assistants is especially attractive -- especially if the donation can be formalized in an official agreement between the PSA and the donating organization. \nThe PSA can also do more direct outreach to members, both through the PSA mailing list and at the time of registration with the member website (an option that bears some similarities to “membership fees”, discussed below).\nSummary\nCharitable giving is highly flexible and has generated some money for the PSA, though often the specific monetary amounts are small. One attractive option for the PSA now that it is a nonprofit is to accept more donations of time from member lab research assistants. This option works best when the agreement is formalized through an official agreement and when the research assistant can be embedded within a PSA supervisory structure.\n\n\nFees-for-service\nA fee-for-service venture involves directly selling something, rather as a for-profit company would. Some of the proceeds from sales go toward maintaining the fee-for-service venture; the rest go toward supporting other activities within the organization.\nOne particularly interesting service the PSA can provide is translation. The PSA has extensive experience translating psychological tasks and measures into multiple languages. Moreover, the PSA has experience implementing the translations in software. Finally, if the PSA can help researchers recruit participants from more countries and cultures, that furthers its mission of ensuring that psychological science is more representative of humanity writ large. We will have more to say on this subject below.\nFees-for-service ventures are difficult to classify in terms of their effort, risk, yield, and volatility; much depends on the specific venture under consideration. Nevertheless, we believe they are underexplored and could usefully complement the PSA’s other efforts.\nStrengths\n\nCan leverage already-existing strengths of the organization. If an organization must already be skilled at a specific task, developing a business around that skill allows the organization to leverage its existing strengths to generate a sustainable income. For example, the PSA must accomplish many things to conduct a multi-site study, including develop a large, global community of scientists and researchers around a common mission, coordinate agreements across many institutions, develop materials that are appropriate across many cultures, translate those materials into many languages, create and maintain large databases about its members, and disseminate knowledge about multi-site studies. Many of these skills can be leveraged into an income-generating enterprise. \nBuilds a sustainable income stream. Once established, a fee-for-service income stream can sustain itself over long periods of time, buffering against the risks associated with other income streams (for example, a grant running out after three years).\nThe money is flexible. Because the money that comes from a fee-for-service venture is earned rather than donated by a third party, there is no donor who can attach strings to how the money is used. Thus, this money is very flexible and can be used to support staff salaries and any other activities the PSA desires.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nStartup risks. Startups require up-front investments and there is no guarantee that a market will materialize. Thus, any investment made into a fee-for-service venture may, in the worst case, be lost.\nMission capture. On the other hand, if a fee-for-service venture is very successful, that venture may capture the mission of the non-profit as a whole. Thus, fee-for-service ventures work best when they are well in line with the primary aims of the non-profit.\nConflicts of interest. Some fees-for-service ventures may create conflicts of interest for PSA members who work on them, as these ventures may create incentives that conflict with the PSA’s core mission.\n\nWhat have we done already?\n\nA PSA conference. This year, the PSA hosted its first conference, PSACON2020. The PSA charged a $60 registration fee with a generous waiver policy -- the conference was planned on the assumption that ⅔ of the participants would receive waivers. The conference had 62 paying attendees (plus many more who received waivers) and brought in $3,720. This money went towards supporting the salary of the PSA’s junior administrator (and the main organizer of the conference), Savannah Lewis.\n\nWhat else can we do?\nFees-for-service are a largely untapped opportunity for the PSA. Conducting multi-site studies is difficult and the PSA has developed a broad array of institutional knowledge to complete these studies. Much of this institutional knowledge can be leveraged into marketable services.\nThe success of PSACON2020 suggests that we could continue this conference in the future. If attendance remains stable or grows, this could become a small but consistent funding stream for the PSA.\nA second interesting option is starting a dedicated PSA journal. This option entails some risk, as projects published there cannot be published in journals that are currently very prestigious (such as Nature Human Behaviour); authors on projects therefore take on some personal risk in the decision to instead publish at the PSA journal. It is also unclear whether university libraries would be willing to pay subscription fees for a PSA journal. On the other hand, the success of society journals suggests that once this revenue source is established, it could be a large and reliable one.\nOne last interesting option is translation. Translation of psychological measures and tasks is difficult, yet the PSA has lots of experience pulling off this task. PSA member Adeyemi Adetula has proposed a PSA-affiliated translation service with a first focus on Africa. This blog contains two surveys, one for people interested in being paid translators and one for people who want measures and tasks translated. If you are interested in this idea as a means of funding the PSA, head over to the blog, read the proposal, and complete one or both of the surveys.\nSummary\nFees-for-service involves leveraging the PSA’s strengths to sell a service, generating a new income stream. The PSA has started some limited versions of fee-for-service funding, but this is still a largely untapped opportunity. \nIn addition to continuing the success of PSACON, the PSA could explore starting a service to provide translations of psychological tasks and measures. Both these activities are in line with the PSA’s core mission -- the conference because it builds community and supports members, translation because it provides the translated measures and tasks necessary to recruit participants whose native language is not English.\n\n\nMembership dues\nMembership dues are a special case of fee-for-service funding, but the model fits the structure of the PSA so well that it is worth discussing in its own section. The membership dues model involves charging some amount of money to gain access to some or all of the benefits of PSA membership. This is the model followed by scientific societies, which often gate grant funding and conference participation in exchange for annual dues of, say, $247 (APA) or $237 (APS).\nMembership dues also have some overlap with some forms of charitable giving. This is because one way to ask for a donation is at the time of registration through the PSA member website. The major difference between this sort of solicitation and a membership fee is whether the default membership is free or paid. Membership dues do have one major, somewhat hidden, advantage over a solicitation at the time of member registration: due to grant accounting rules, many PSA members who have their own grants cannot spend this money on donations. On the other hand, grant money can typically be spent on a membership fee. Instituting membership dues may therefore unlock grant money that is currently inaccessible to the PSA.\nSome implementations of membership dues may conflict with a core value of the PSA, namely diversity and inclusion. If dues are required of all members, they risk pushing out prospective PSA members with less resources. There may be implementations of membership dues (such as a dues structure that allows for fee waivers) that can help mitigate this risk. \nWe believe that membership dues are low effort, moderate risk, medium yield, and low volatility. They therefore allow for better long-term planning than many other funding streams. However, we also believe that the specific kinds of risks that membership dues incur require feedback from PSA members before we rush into any decisions. We have created a survey to help seek this feedback; we lay out more context for why we see such promise in dues below.\nStrengths\n\nMany people have pots of money that cannot be given as gifts. Under the Grant-writing section, we noted that grant funds are inflexible. One consequence of this lack of flexibility is that PSA boosters who have grant funds are often not allowed to use them in charitable gifts because the expense cannot be justified to the granting agency. Membership dues provide a way for these people to justify giving money to the PSA to granting agencies, thus unlocking a resource for the PSA that would otherwise go untapped.\nLeverages the PSA’s best resource, its community. The great strength of the PSA is that it has created a large international community (1400 members and counting) that believes in its mission. Membership dues allow the PSA to leverage this strength to better secure its long-term sustainability.\nDues are linked to PSA member benefits. The PSA provides many benefits to members, including a connection with a large international community of colleagues and collaborators, exposure to cutting edge methods, and access to high-impact that can be added to one’s CV. Membership dues would emphasize that the PSA is only able to provide these things by maintaining a large infrastructure.\nPrecedent in scientific societies. The dues funding model is the same one used by scientific societies, so dues-granted membership should be a concept that is familiar to PSA members.\nWide variety of potential implementations. Dues can be charged on a yearly basis or could be tied to joining a study (the cost of joining would be an administrative fee). The PSA could also consider a variety of waiver policies.\nThe money is flexible. The money is earned, so it could go toward supporting everything from staff salaries to ad hoc projects.\nBuilds a stable income stream. Once a membership dues program is in place, the income stream from the program should be relatively stable year-to-year.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nRisk of lowering membership. Gating membership by adding a joining fee could lower PSA membership, draining the PSA of its most valuable resource. Some policies could help manage this risk -- for example, the membership dues could be suggested rather than required.\nRisk of driving away members with fewer resources. The PSA has a particular interest in increasing its membership in countries that provide less support for the sciences, such as those in the African continent. Imposing membership dues could put joining the PSA out of reach for these prospective members. Once again, policy could help manage this risk -- for example, the PSA could provide generous waivers, just as it did for PSACON.\n\nWhat have we done already?\nNothing.\nWhat else can we do?\nMembership dues come with some real risks, so we want to carefully investigate this option before we take any hasty action. We also want to ensure that whatever action we take has the broad support of the PSA membership. \nWe have prepared a survey to investigate what PSA members think about different models of membership dues. By taking this survey you can help us evaluate the feasibility of using this as an income stream to promote the sustainability of the PSA.\nSummary\nMembership dues is arguably the funding model that best fits the structure of the PSA. However, some implementations of dues may conflict with the PSA value of diversity and inclusion. Membership dues have great potential as a funding stream, but we should think carefully about whether and how to implement them.\n\n\nConclusion\nWe strongly believe that the PSA has the potential to do enormous good for psychological science, and perhaps the social sciences at large. However, fulfilling this potential will require dedicated funding, and to obtain this funding the PSA may have to look beyond its current focus on grant-writing and charitable giving. Of course, the PSA need not abandon these income streams; it can simply balance these activities with efforts in developing funding streams through, say, fees-for-service ventures and membership dues.\nIf the PSA does develop a more balanced financial strategy, it will need staff to manage this strategy. This probably means appointing a Chief Financial Officer and a bookkeeper. The Center for Open Science, for example, has staff to manage its financial strategy and its books.\nThe PSA is at a crossroads. We think it has a real opportunity to grow into a more formal and mature organization that carries the big team science torch for psychology at large."

    "section": "",
    "text": "We are pleased to announce that our third official study, proposed by Dr. Sau-Chin Chen of Tzu-Chi University, has been selected. It will examine the extent to which the object orientation effect, in which language comprehension can guide later perception, extends across numerous world languages. For example, a picture of a flying eagle is identified faster after reading “He saw the eagle in the sky” than “He saw the eagle in the nest.”\n\nHere is a bit more information from Sau-Chin:\n\nWhen we read a sentence describing an object in context, such as ‘The eagle is in the sky’, our minds simulate the visual properties of the eagle. This general concept is supported by findings from the sentence-picture verification task. In this task, target objects that match the probe sentence (e.g., the flying eagle) are identified faster than target objects that mismatch the probe sentence (e.g., the sitting eagle). This pattern is called the “match advantage.” So far, this effect has been relatively robust across a range of characteristics of target objects, such as shape, color, size, and orientation. These specific match advantages are named the shape effect, the color effect, the size effect, and the orientation effect, respectively. However, there is some inconsistency in orientation effect findings between the studies with a comprehension task (Stanfield & Zwaan, 2001; Zwaan & Pecher, 2012) and studies without a comprehension task (De Koning, Wassenburg, Bos, & van der Schoot, 2017; Hoeben-Mannaert, Dijkstra, & Zwaan, 2017). This project aims to identify the source of these inconsistent findings and assess the extent to which the effect generalizes across languages.\n\nWe have also decided to “bundle” this study with Dr. Curtis Phill’s investigation of the gendered nature of social category representations. This bundling will allow us to efficiently collect data for both studies in a large and international sample using a single combined and brief (less than 30 minutes) data collection session in each lab. We will begin recruiting specific labs from our network for this combined data collection process in the coming weeks. Please congratulate Sau-Chin and stay tuned!

    "text": "The PSA owes its success to the enthusiasm of its members. That enthusiasm has led to an outpouring of volunteer work hours. In 2019, we estimate that these hours total 19,390, equivalent to approximately 10 full-time people per year. However, enthusiastic volunteerism has its limits. First, some items, such as software licenses and compensation for participants, cannot be bought solely with volunteer labor. Second, volunteer time necessarily comes at the expense of time spent on other activities -- activities that more directly benefit one’s career. Thus, for the PSA to maximize its positive impact, it needs to develop a broad set of reliable funding streams, both to enable special projects that require direct funding and to guard against the eventuality that enthusiasm for the PSA diminishes. That’s where you come in. We have recently created a Patreon page to allow interested people to make regular contributions to help the PSA fulfill its goals. The exact items that we fund with the Patreon will change on a regular basis; however, we have made a pledge that all the money we receive through this Patreon page will be reinvested into the PSA in a way that directly supports our mission and is in line with our core principles. In the coming year, we hope to use the Patreon to fund two items, both of which will be discussed further in a blog post of their own later this week:\n\nSix grants of $400 to PSA member labs who wish to collect data for one of our studies but lack the resources to do so\nSix stipends of $400 to help compensate people who take on study-specific administrative roles\n\nWe will feel comfortable funding these if our Patreon reaches the threshold of $400 per month by Tuesday September 3, 5pm UTC. We will provide regular updates as to our progress. If you are able to donate a monthly contribution and you think our goal is worthy, consider becoming a patron. Even $1 a month gets us closer to your goal. Help us reach our goal and thereby incrementally advance the improvement of psychological science!"

You can read the candidates’ statements at the links below to prepare for the vote.\nSecond, we are continuing data collection on the PSA-Covid-Rapid studies as long as we can afford to, which is likely through the end of August. The team could use some more data collection help to make sure we clear our pre-registered N targets! Email psacovid@gmail.com if you are interested in joining or have questions about joining.\nElection\nThe two candidates in our election for an open Associate Director position, Peter Mallik and John Protzko, have provided written statements describing why they've chosen to run, and describing what they'd like to achieve in the Associate Director role if elected. \nYou can read each statement by clicking the candidate's name here: Mallik and Protzko. Additionally, we have posted each statement in dedicated slack channels. I encourage all members to read them, consider them carefully, and ask any questions you have for the candidates! You can ask questions by joining the PSA slack workspace at this link, and then joining the #associatedirectorelection_protzko and #associatedirectorelection_mallik channels. The slack discussion closes today, but you can read the questions and answers throughout the election. Soon, we will email each PSA member with instructions about how to vote.\nConference\nApproximately ⅔ of the available seats are full, so make sure to register now to claim your spot if you’d like to attend. We have a recent surge of attendees requesting free admission, and would very much like to to be able to fill all requests, so we would be very grateful if a few additional members were able and willing to pay the $60 admission fee to open up more free spots. Also, the program is  slowly but surely filling up. If you have work or ideas you would like to present at the conference be sure to fill out of new submission form! We’ve started a general info page that highlights a few presentations already set and links out to the current draft program. We hope to have the full program set in late August and will share an update with the full network when it is ready to go!\nCurrent Studies\n\nPSA 001- The Stage 2 Registered Report has been resubmitted to Nature Human Behaviour. Now we are waiting for the final decision from the editor.\nPSA 002/003- The 002 and 003 teams are in the final stages of moving our experiments from Open Sesame/Qualtrics to Lab.JS. Thanks to the hard work of Merle Schuckart, we have drafts of the new programs and are in the process of ensuring that the web versions of the studies retain fidelity to the original protocols and troubleshooting the studies. The new version of the experiment should fully integrate both the 002 and 003 procedures into one online protocol, greatly simplifying future data collection.\nPSA 004- Data collection has slowed down as many members’ universities have concluded their semesters. We do however need more CREP reviewers as we wrap up this project at the end of the year. CREP reviewers look over each lab’s OSF page to ensure that each lab is performing the study as planned. If you or someone else is interested please have them fill out this form.\nPSA 005- 005 is waiting on a decision on our Stage 1 submission at Nature Human Behaviour.\nPSA 006- 006 is continuing data collection and is slated to finish sometime between October and December. We continue to have new labs join and are extremely excited to finish up this year!\nPSACR 001/002/003- The PSACR bundle is still collecting data. We now have over 19,000 participants (i.e., people who have completed the general questions about the pandemic and participated in one or more of the study surveys). The survey is offered in 38 (!!) languages and dialects, with a handful more to be implemented very soon. We are still planning to collect data as long as we can afford to, which we expect to be through August. We are also welcoming new labs to join data collection if they use one of the languages we've translated already (see here for a list of implemented and soon-to-be implemented languages http://formr.psysciacc.org/shiny/shiny_app/) . Email psacovid@gmail.com if you are interested in joining or have questions about joining.\n\nA Chapter on the PSA, QRPS, and Clinical Psych\nA group of PSA members, led by Julie Beshears, are beginning work on an invited chapter about the PSA and how the PSA's design can affect the presence of questionable research practices (QRPs) in clinical psychology research.  Ideally, they are seeking individuals with clinical experience, but other contributions are welcome.  If this project interests you, you may join the slack channel (proj_clinical_chapter) or email Julie at jebeshears@eagles.usi.edu.\nCommittee Updates\n\nEthics committee- We would like to congratulate our newest Assistant Director of the ethics committee!! Mike Mensink was just appointed the position last week and seems very eager to start in his new position. Welcome Mike and we look forward to collaborating with you soon!\n\n\n\nTranslation and Cultural Diversity Committee- The Translation and Cultural Diversity Committee (TCDC) would like to collect data on the translation capacity of the PSA for future projects: in which countries and for which languages do we have adequate potential translators? This knowledge will help us to determine our potential capacity, or lack-there-of, in many possible data collection languages, and thus make better plans for future projects. Please answer this very short, 1-minute survey, to help us. Thank you!!\n\n\n\nProject monitoring Committee- The member website is receiving an update soon. A big shout out to the fantastic Erin Buchanan for helping the team find a way to manage projects through Canvas. Erin will be going over this update and much more at the conference in September, so make sure you check that out for more information!\n\nRecorded for the Chinese Open Science Network Available Online \nChris Chartier recently gave a talk to the Chinese Open Science Network. They recorded the presentations and have posted it here, so anyone can watch and reach out with any questions or feedback (cchartie@ashland.edu). \nThank you for all that you have, and continue to do, on behalf of the PSA. Onward!\nSavannah and Chris"

This proposal was submitted by Bence Bago (Toulouse School of Economics, France) and Balazs Aczel (Eotvos Lorand University, Hungary). Congratulations! The project focuses on people’s reasoning in moral dilemmas in which deontological perspectives (emphasizing individual rights) are in conflict with consequentialist reasoning (following the greater good). In an important and central experiment, Greene et al. (2009) investigated whether people are sensitive to the intention of agents when evaluating moral actions. They found that this is only the case when people have to apply personal force to do so. Yet, their work could not explore the effect of a potentially important component: culture. Therefore, the goal of the present project is to empirically test the universality of the effect of intention on utilitarian and deontological responding by directly replicating Greene et al.’s experiments in non-WEIRD samples as well. You can read the accepted proposal here: https://osf.io/d2ptq/ Stay tuned for more information on lab recruitment and project planning soon!

We are currently a group of 7; however, we are almost exclusively located in the US and Europe, and we want to meet the diverse needs of all PSA-represented regions and beyond. Currently, we have the following roles: 1) provide reviews of proposed PSA projects with an eye toward ethics, 2) provide reviews of accepted PSA project IRB and ethics review board materials prior to distribution to the larger PSA group, 3) provide ethics-oriented consultation to ongoing PSA projects, 4) work with other PSA committees to ensure ethical practices. Zoom-based meetings are approximately monthly. For more information and/or to submit a CV, please contact Erica Musser at emusser@fiu.edu.\nStudy Selection Committee: The Study Selection Committee serves a vital role in the workflow of the PSA by facilitating the review of proposed projects and ultimately deciding on their acceptance to be run by our network. We are currently seeking 2-4 new members to aid in our next round of selection in late summer and early fall of this year. Committee members must commit to serve for 1 year but may choose to resign at any point thereafter. Unlike many of the other PSA committees, the work of the Study Selection Committee is concentrated to a few months per year. The PSA solicits study proposal submissions on an ad hoc basis. After each call for submissions is closed, the Study Selection Committee evaluates the submissions for feasibility and general quality. We then vote on whether each proposal merits review. Suitable proposals are then reviewed by experts in and outside of the network. The Study Selection Committee compiles and synthesizes this feedback. The committee then makes the final selections on the basis of reviewers’ responses, evaluations from the PSA network, and the PSA’s mission, values and capacity. If you would like to join the committee, please submit a CV to committee co-chair and PSA Assistant Director Kathleen Schmidt (kathleenschmidt1@gmail.com or kathleen.schmidt@siu.edu).\nTraining Committee: The Training Committee is recruiting committee coordinators to help organize and provide trainings for the PSA and larger science community. If you are interested in joining our team, please read about our openings and apply! Link: https://forms.gle/yiS89d22bNA6P5hRA\nTranslation Coordinator for Study 004, The Accelerated CREP Project: We are looking for a translation coordinator for PSA 004 (Accelerated CREP) to coordinate and monitor the translations according to PSA’s translation policies. The Accelerated CREP is a pedagogical project conducted by student teams in collaboration with faculty supervisors. The preprint of the registered report (under review and hopefully very close to an in principle acceptance at AMPPS) is available at https://psyarxiv.com/zeux9 . The study is currently translated into nine different languages and most of these are ready for the next step in the translation process (back translations and controlling for equivalence). The translation coordinator is expected to coordinate the remainder of the translation process and monitor them. The translation coordinator will earn authorship on the resulting manuscript."

All PSA projects require pre-registration of the research: When it is confirmatory, a pre-registration of hypotheses, methods, and analysis plans (e.g., Van’t Veer & Giner-Sorolla, 2016), and when it is exploratory, an explicit statement saying so. In addition, open data, open code, open materials, and depositing an open- access preprint report of the empirical results are required.\n\n\nRigor\nThe PSA currently enables, supports, or requires appropriately large samples (Cohen, 1992; Ioannidis, 2005), expert review of the theoretical rationale (Cronbach & Meehl, 1955; LeBel, Berger, Campbell, & Loving, 2017), and vetting of methods by advisors with expertise in measurement and quantitative analysis.\n\n\nOpenness to criticism\nThe PSA integrates critical assessment of its policies and research products into its process, requiring extensive review of all projects and annually soliciting external feedback on the organization as a whole."

    "text": "The Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA) is a globally distributed network of researchers (2468 researchers from 73 countries) that pool intellectual and material resources to accelerate the accumulation of rigorous knowledge in psychological science. Below is some information about how we got started, our guiding principles, notable accomplishments, and future directions.\n\nBeginnings\nThe PSA began in August 2017 with a blog post titled “Building a CERN for Psychological Science,” in which one of the founders, Chris Chartier, called on multiple research labs to join together to create a large-scale research consortium. By virtue of its membership across multiple countries, it was argued that a large enough consortium could recruit larger and more diverse samples of research participants than would be possible in only one research lab. The post was shared widely, and 100 labs signed up for the consortium one month after the post went live. In the early days of the project, the ever-expanding membership selected the name “The Psychological Science Accelerator” for the consortium, established sustainable governance, and drafted the consortium’s guiding principles, which were later published in Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science.\n\n\nCore Principles\nThe founding members of the PSA established the following core principles:\n\nDiversity and Inclusion: Endeavor towards diversity and inclusion in every aspect of the PSA’s functioning. This includes cultural and geographic diversity among participants and researchers conducting PSA-supported projects, as well as a diversity of research topics.\nDecentralized Authority: Have policies and procedures set by committees in conjunction with the PSA community at large. Have members collectively guide the direction of the PSA through the policies they vote for and the projects they support.\nTransparency: Mandate transparent practices in policies, procedures, and supported projects. For example, in confirmatory PSA projects, hypotheses, methods, and analysis plans should be specified and documented a-priori. Exploratory projects and analyses should be explicitly identified as so. Data, code, materials, and preprints of empirical results are required to be made openly available to the public.\nRigor: Enable, support, or require relatively large sampling plans, expert reviews of study rationale, and vetting of methods by members with expertise in measurement and quantitative analysis.\nOpenness to criticism: Integrate critical assessment into all policies and research products. Require extensive review of all projects and regularly solicit external feedback on the organization as a whole.\n\n\n\nKey Accomplishments\nBrought together a large researcher base. The PSA has demonstrated that there is wide-ranging support for big team science. As of 2023, 2468 researchers from 73 countries have joined the network. Often on a volunteer basis, these researchers contribute to the PSA in several ways, including: collecting data, serving on committees, donating funds, conducting novel methodological and meta-scientific research, supporting the management of projects and data releases, devising analysis plans, and reviewing submissions for future PSA projects.\nEstablished sustainable governance. As of December 2020, the PSA is fiscally sponsored by the Open Collective Foundation and led by a Director, four Associate Directors, an ever-shifting number of committees led by 1-2 Assistant Directors, and a grassroots network of contributors. Committees regularly meet to establish workflows, develop policies, and provide guidance to PSA projects.\nSelected and initiated over a dozen large-scale projects. The PSA currently has over a dozen large-scale projects. See of projects page (link) for more information.\nReceived recognition from the scientific community. In 2019, the PSA was recognized through the Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science’s Leadership Award. In 2021, the PSA was recognized through the Society for Personality and Social Psychology Service to the Field Award. The PSA has also received positive coverage from several popular press outlets, including Science Magazine, FiveThirtyEight, and Buzzfeed.\n\n\nCurrent Aims\nBetween 2022-2025, the PSA is primarily pursuing 6 aims. For more information, see our 2022-2025 Vision Plan.\n\nAddress the “generalizability crisis” as it applies to methodology, measurement, sampling, and data analysis\nImprove psychological science through meta-science research\nCreate opportunities for PSA members to initiate and collaborate on “affiliated” projects\nBuild infrastructure for large-scale collaboration networks\nImprove the diversity of psychological science\nEstablish long-term organizational and financial sustainability"

We thus seek to leverage big team science to address big questions rooted in theory and/or real-world problems. For example, of the 12+ projects in our study portfolio, we have:\n\nTested whether COVID-19-related cognitive framing manipulations impact emotions, behaviors, attitudes, and well-being around the world.\nExamined cultural and situations forces that shape moral dilemma judgments.\nExamined the extent to which stereotype threat impacts academic performance among African American college students."

Recently, research on the predictive validity of ideal partner preference-matching (i.e., do people positively evaluate partners who match versus mismatch their ideals?) has become mired in several problems. For one, articles exhibit discrepant analytic and reporting practices. Furthermore, different findings emerge across laboratories worldwide, perhaps because they sample different relationship contexts and/or populations. The current project—partnered with the Psychological Science Accelerator—can bring clarity to this literature. This registered report uses a highly powered design across multiple world regions to calculate preference-matching effect sizes and variability estimates for all relevant analytic tests. It also examines effects in different relationship contexts and subsamples (e.g., attraction, established relationships, recently formed relationships).\n\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      AF002: Gratitude Project\n      To date, gratitude intervention research has mostly relied on WEIRD samples (i.e., people from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic societies).

In this model, two dimensions (valence and dominance) underpin social judgements of faces. Because this model has primarily been developed and tested in Western regions, it is unclear whether these findings apply to other regions. We addressed this question by replicating Oosterhof and Todorov’s methodology across 11 world regions, 41 countries and 11,570 participants. When we used Oosterhof and Todorov’s original analysis strategy, the valence–dominance model generalized across regions. When we used an alternative methodology to allow for correlated dimensions, we observed much less generalization. Collectively, these results suggest that, while the valence–dominance model generalizes very well across regions when dimensions are forced to be orthogonal, regional differences are revealed when we use different extraction methods and correlate and rotate the dimension reduction solution.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n      PSA002: Object Orientation\n      \n        prereg\n        resources\n        preprint\n      \n      Mental simulation theories of language comprehension propose that people automatically create mental representations of real objects. Evidence from sentence-picture verification tasks has shown that people mentally represent various visual properties such as shape, color, and size. However, the evidence for mental simulations of object orientation is limited. We report a study that investigates the match advantage of object orientation across speakers of different languages. This multi-laboratory project aims to achieve two objectives. First, we examine the replicability of the match advantage of object orientation across multiple languages and laboratories. Second, we will use a mental rotation task to measure participants’ mental imagery after the sentence-picture verification task. The relationship between the participants’ performance of the two tasks will provide a cross-linguistic examination of perceptual simulation processes. With the (broad) evaluation of individual mental imagery ability and potential linguistic moderators, we expect a robust estimation of match advantage of object orientation.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      PSA003: Gendered Prejudice\n      When asked to imagine a person, people tend to think of a man (Hamilton, 1991). The same is true for some social groups as well–when asked to imagine a Black or White person, people tend to imagine a Black or White man (Schug, Alt, & Klauer, 2015). One reason for this is androcentrism: the belief that men are the default and women are the exception or “other” (Bailey, LaFrance, & Dovidio, 2018; Bem, 1993; Smith & Zarate, 1992).The present research will describe the gendered nature of prejudice for seven social categories (i.e., Black people, East Asian people, White people, police, politicians, and criminals). We hypothesized that, if prejudice occurs for the group, it is more strongly related to prejudice toward the men of that social category than toward the women of that category. This study was conducted across several laboratories and languages and was paired with PSA 002 for data collection.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n      PSA004: True Belief\n      \n        preprint\n      \n      According to the Justified True Belief account of knowledge (JTB), a person can only truly know something if they have a belief that is both justified and true (i.e., knowledge is justified true belief). This account was challenged by Gettier (1963), who argued that JTB does not explain knowledge attributions in certain situations, later called Gettier-type cases, wherein a protagonist is justified in believing something to be true but their belief was only correct due to luck. Lay people may not attribute knowledge to protagonists with justified but only luckily true beliefs. While some research has found evidence for these so-called Gettier intuitions (e.g., Machery et al., 2017a), Turri et al. (2015) found that participants attributed knowledge in Gettier-type cases at rates similar to cases of justified true belief. In a large-scale, cross-cultural conceptual replication of Turri and colleagues’ (2015) Experiment 1 (N = 4724), we failed to replicate this null result using a within-subjects design and three vignettes across 19 geopolitical regions. Instead, participants demonstrated Gettier intuitions; they were 1.86 times more likely to attribute knowledge to protagonists in standard cases of justified true belief than to protagonists in Gettier-type cases. These results suggest that Gettier intuitions may be common across different scenarios and cultural contexts. When assessing the knowledge of others, lay people may rely on a shared set of epistemic intuitions (i.e., a core folk epistemology) that requires more than simply justification, belief, and truth. However, the size of the Gettier intuition effect did vary by vignette, and the Turri et al. (2015) vignette produced the smallest effect. Thus, epistemic intuitions may also depend on contextual factors unrelated to the criteria of knowledge, such as the characteristics of the protagonist being evaluated.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n      PSA005: Stereotype Threat\n      \n        preprint\n      \n      According to stereotype threat theory, the possibility of confirming a negative group stereotype evokes feelings of threat, leading people to underperform in domains where they are stereotyped as lacking ability. This theory has immense theoretical and practical implications. However, many studies supporting it include small samples and varying operational definitions of “stereotype threat”. We address the first challenge by leveraging a network of psychology labs to recruit a large Black student sample (*N~anticipated~* = 2700) from multiple US sites (*N~anticipated~* = 27). We address the second challenge by identifying three threat-increasing and three threat-decreasing procedures that could plausibly affect performance and use an adaptive Bayesian design to determine which operationalization yields the strongest evidence for underperformance. This project should advance our knowledge of a scientifically and socially important topic: the conditions under which stereotype threat affects performance among current Black students in the United States.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n      PSA006: Trolley Problem\n      \n        paper\n        preprint\n        RR stage 1\n        resources\n        OSF\n      \n      The study of moral judgements often centres on moral dilemmas in which options consistent with deontological perspectives (that is, emphasizing rules, individual rights and duties) are in conflict with options consistent with utilitarian judgements (that is, following the greater good based on consequences). Greene et al. (2009) showed that psychological and situational factors (for example, the intent of the agent or the presence of physical contact between the agent and the victim) can play an important role in moral dilemma judgements (for example, the trolley problem). Our knowledge is limited concerning both the universality of these effects outside the United States and the impact of culture on the situational and psychological factors affecting moral judgements. Thus, we empirically tested the universality of the effects of intent and personal force on moral dilemma judgements by replicating the experiments of Greene et al. in 45 countries from all inhabited continents. We found that personal force and its interaction with intention exert influence on moral judgements in the US and Western cultural clusters, replicating and expanding the original findings. Moreover, the personal force effect was present in all cultural clusters, suggesting it is culturally universal. The evidence for the cultural universality of the interaction effect was inconclusive in the Eastern and Southern cultural clusters (depending on exclusion criteria). We found no strong association between collectivism/individualism and moral dilemma judgements.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n      PSA007: SPAM-L\n      \n        preprint\n      \n      Semantic priming has been studied for nearly 50 years across various experimental manipulations and theoretical frameworks. These studies provide insight into the cognitive underpinnings of semantic representations in both healthy and clinical populations; however, they have suffered from several issues including generally low sample sizes and a lack of diversity in linguistic implementations. Here, we will test the size and the variability of the semantic priming effect across ten languages by creating a large database of semantic priming values, based on an adaptive sampling procedure. Differences in response latencies between related word-pair conditions and unrelated word-pair conditions (i.e., difference score confidence interval is greater than zero) will allow quantifying evidence for semantic priming, whereas improvements in model fit with the addition of a random intercept for language will provide support for variability in semantic priming across languages.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      PSA008: Minimal Groups\n      Biases in favor of culturally prevalent social ingroups are ubiquitous, but random assignment to meaningless experimentally created social groups is also sufficient to create ingroup biases (i.e., the minimal group effect; MGE). Thus, the extent to which ingroup bias arises from specific social contexts versus more general psychological tendencies remains unclear. This registered report focuses on three questions. First, how culturally prevalent is the MGE? Second, how do critical cultural and individual factors moderate its strength? Third, does the MGE meaningfully relate to culturally salient real-world ingroup biases? Here we compare the MGE to bias in favor of a family member (i.e., first cousin) and a national ingroup member. We propose to recruit a sample of &gt; 200 participants in each of &gt; 50 nations to examine these questions and advance our understanding of the psychological foundations and cultural prevalence of ingroup bias.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      PSA-JTF1: Moral Experiences\n      \n        preprint\n      \n      Do people in different societies experience morality differently in everyday life? Using experience sampling methods, we investigate everyday moral experiences in a sample from 20 countries across 6 continents, thereby replicating and extending a large-scale study originally conducted in the United States and Canada. We aim to replicate key findings about the kinds of moral experiences people have, the relationship between such experiences and religious or political affiliation, how such experiences affect momentary feelings, and how such experiences influence moral behavior. An international sample enables us to assess the generalizability of these findings across different socio-cultural contexts.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      PSA-JTF2: Dignity Honor Face\n      The cultural logics of dignity, honor, and face describe different grounds for evaluating a person’s worth and ensuring cooperation that vary in prevalence across cultures. We will collaboratively develop and validate a measure capturing these cultural logics, which will allow us to map world cultures on the prevalence of these logics. We will further explore the interrelations of dignity, honor, and face with prosocial behavior, values, moral beliefs, and religiosity, and the generalizability of these relationships across cultures. Finally, we will test historical antecedents (e.g., historical threats) and current correlates (e.g., inequality) of country-level prevalence of these cultural logics. This study will generate a new dataset of country scores for dignity, honor, and face that will be available for future comparative research. It will also provide valuable theoretical insights for researchers and practitioners interested in cooperation and (pro)social behavior across cultures.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \n      PSA-JTF3: Error Correction\n      Our intuition intelligently guides our thinking but can also, at times, be a source of errors. Recent research suggests that, surprisingly, deliberation corrects only a small fraction of such errors, whereas providing feedback and motivating accuracy encourages corrective behaviour. However, these findings are limited to WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich, and Democratic) samples, and whether people’s corrective behaviour around the world is guided by similar mechanisms is unclear. In the large-scale experiment proposed here, a culturally diverse sample of participants will solve problems that elicit appealing yet incorrect intuitions twice: first, intuitively, then, reflectively, allowing them to correct initial errors in a 2 (feedback: absent vs. present) × 2 (answer justification: absent vs. present) between-participants design. We will also examine the role of cross-cultural and individual differences, including metacognitive aspects of error recognition, in corrective behaviour. The results will shed light on the nature, universality, and promotion of corrective behaviour.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n      PSA-CR 001: Loss Gain\n      \n        paper\n        preprint\n      \n      The COVID-19 pandemic presents a critical need to identify best practices for communicating health information to the global public. It also provides an opportunity to test theories about risk communication. As part of a larger Psychological Science Accelerator COVID-19 Rapid Project, a global consortium of researchers will experimentally test competing hypotheses regarding the effects of framing messages in terms of losses versus gains. We will examine effects on three primary outcomes: intentions to adhere to policies designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19, opinions about such policies, and the likelihood that participants seek additional policy information. Whereas research on negativity bias and loss aversion predicts that loss-framing will have greater impact, research on encouraging the adoption of protective health behaviour suggests the opposite (i.e., gain-framing will be more persuasive). We will also assess effects on experienced anxiety. Given the potentially low cost and the scalable nature of framing interventions, results could be valuable to health organizations, policymakers, and news sources globally.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n      PSA-CR 002: Cognitive Reappraisal\n      \n        paper\n      \n      The COVID-19 pandemic has increased negative emotions and decreased positive emotions globally. Left unchecked, these emotional changes might have a wide array of adverse impacts. To reduce negative emotions and increase positive emotions, we tested the effectiveness of reappraisal, an emotion-regulation strategy that modifies how one thinks about a situation. Participants from 87 countries and regions (*n* = 21,644) were randomly assigned to one of two brief reappraisal interventions (reconstrual or repurposing) or one of two control conditions (active or passive). Results revealed that both reappraisal interventions (vesus both control conditions) consistently reduced negative emotions and increased positive emotions across different measures. Reconstrual and repurposing interventions had similar effects. Importantly, planned exploratory analyses indicated that reappraisal interventions did not reduce intentions to practice preventive health behaviours. The findings demonstrate the viability of creating scalable, low-cost interventions for use around the world.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n      PSA-CR 003: Self Determination\n      \n        paper\n        preprint\n        resources\n      \n      In order to slow the transmission of COVID-19, governments around the world are asking their citizens to participate in social distancing, that is, to stay at home as much as possible. In most countries, individuals have some choice over whether or not they follow recommendations for social distancing. Thus, understanding how to best motivate social distancing has become a critical public health priority. This study tests, in a confirmatory manner, whether self-determination theory-guided message framing impacts people’s motivation to participate in social distancing. Specifically, we expect autonomy-supportive messages that help people understand the value of behavior change to a) increase ‘buy in’, or autonomous motivation, for social distancing, b) lower feelings of defiance to follow recommendations around social distancing, and c) increase feelings of self-efficacy to participate in social distancing, relative to neutral and controlling messages. Further, we expect controlling messages that pressure people to change using shame, guilt, and threats, may backfire and a) decrease ‘buy in’ for social distancing and b) increase defiance, relative to the control condition. Exploratory tests will examine whether the effects of message framing on motivation and defiance extend to behavioral intentions and long-term commitment. This work has direct relevance for how public officials, health professionals, journalists, and others can communicate about solving this and future public health crises in ways that motivate people more effectively.\n\n    \n  \n\n\nNo matching items"

    "title": "The financial cost of the PSA’s vision",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Patrick S. Forscher and Hans IJzerman\nIn 2017, Chris Chartier shared a blog post that revealed a grand vision for psychology research: psychologists could build a “CERN for psychology” that does for psychology what particle accelerators have done for physics. This “CERN for psychology” would be an organization that harnessed, organized, and coordinated the joint efforts of psychology labs throughout the world to take on large, nationally diverse big team science projects.\nThe months after Chris’s blog went live revealed that enough people believed in this vision to start building this “CERN for psychology”. These early efforts would evolve into the Psychological Science Accelerator, a network that, according to our recent study capacity report, now spans 1400 members from 71 countries. In these early months, the PSA also collaboratively developed a set of five guiding principles, namely diversity and inclusion, decentralized authority, transparency, rigor, and openness to criticism, that form a coherent vision for the type of science we want psychology to be. We want to help transform psychology to become more rigorous, transparent, collaborative, and more representative of humanity writ large.\nNow, three years after its founding, the PSA stands at a crossroads. This crossroads relates to our broad vision of what the PSA is and should be and the means through which we achieve that broad vision. This post will cover the first issue. As we will describe, we believe our early documents point to a vision of the PSA as active, rather than passive, but that a lack of funding streams constrains our ability to achieve that mission.\nMinimal and maximal visions of the PSA\nAlthough the PSA was established to coordinate the activities of research labs, there are a wide range of options as to how this coordination is implemented. The specific implementations anchor two radically different visions of the PSA: a minimal vision and a maximal vision.\n\nImagine a PSA that is radically different from the one we have now: the PSA as a mailing list. \nThis mailing list contains the contact information of people who are willing, in principle, to participate in team science projects. To use the mailing list, people design a team science study and email a description of the study to the list. People who receive a study invitation through the mailing list and freely reply to the study proposer. The mailing list itself is unregulated, so there is no vetting process for any of the emails people send over it, nor is there any support for the people who send invitations through the mailing list. This vision of the PSA is highly minimal in the sense that the PSA plays very little role in coordinating or implementing team science projects. However, this vision is also very low cost, as mailing lists are cheap to set up and almost free to maintain. In a sense, this minimalist version of the PSA already exists in the form of StudySwap -- a useful tool, but not a transformative one.\nNow imagine a PSA that is a bit more similar to the one we have now: the PSA as an active implementer of big team science projects.\nIn this vision, the PSA completes all stages of the team science research process. This means that the PSA takes partial ownership over its projects and participates in project decisions. This includes selecting projects to undertake through a rigorous review process, assisting with the theoretical development of studies, and improving on the design of studies by soliciting multiple rounds of feedback from relevant experts. In this vision, the PSA also actively coordinates and manages study teams to ensure that relevant administrative procedures (such as ethics review) are followed and to ensure that the various stages of the project occur on a reasonable schedule. The PSA also takes an active role in communicating completed projects to the world, perhaps by managing its own journal (the Proceedings of the Psychological Science Accelerator) and through its own dedicated press team. Finally, in this vision, the PSA has a variety of procedures to proactively improve its processes, including novel methods research, team science best practice research, project retrospectives, and exit interviews of PSA staffers who decide to leave the organization. This is the deluxe vision of the PSA, a PSA that is active but that requires lots of money and staff to maintain.\nThese two visions of the PSA -- the minimal and maximal -- also anchor an entire universe of in-between visions that are not so extreme. However, what is arguably true is that the vision of the PSA laid out in Chris’s blog post, as well as the one implied the PSA’s five guiding principles, are both much closer to the maximal vision of the PSA than the minimal one.\nMoney is necessary to implement a maximal vision of the PSA\nIf we accept that fulfilling the PSA’s mission requires something closer to a maximal vision of the PSA, we need to find ways to build the PSA into this more maximal vision. At a minimum, building and maintaining a maximal vision of the PSA requires people who can do the activities involved in this maximal vision. These people need to be recruited, managed, and retained, otherwise they will work at cross purposes, get into interpersonal conflicts, and burn out. In short, in addition to the people who carry out the PSA’s vision, the PSA needs an administrative structure to help these people carry out their work.\nThe PSA does, in fact, have a defined administrative structure. We have, for example, defined a set of committees to govern its activities and a set of roles that should be filled for each project. These roles outline an aspiration for the PSA to proactively conduct team science research -- further suggesting that the PSA has a maximalist vision for itself.\nThese roles are many. Our recent evaluation of the PSA’s administrative capacity identifies fully 115 of them. If we assume that each position requires 5 hours per week of work to complete the associated responsibilities, the 115 roles require 29,900 hours per year to staff. Unfortunately, maintaining this level of labor has, at times, been challenging because of our reliance on volunteers who have other daily commitments (such as jobs that pay them).\nWe can rely on volunteers to carry this load for a time, but doing so carries some real risks. For example, the heavy load can risk burning out the most active volunteers who take on the most labor and lead to large, costly mistakes if the labor requirements for large projects are not met. This load can also provoke interpersonal conflict if active volunteers feel that their labor is not properly recognized or credited. Finally, there are risks associated with who is able to be a volunteer: in a volunteer model, only those who can afford to will donate their time and efforts to the PSA. This squeezes out the voices and talents of some of the very people the PSA wants to elevate, such as those from Africa, Middle America, and South America. Our 2020-2021 study capacity report estimates that 90% of all people involved in administrative roles are from North America and Western Europe. The majority of these, 63% of all administrative roles, are located in North America.\nOther growing organizations have managed the transition from an exclusively volunteer organization to one that is funded by some sort of income stream. We can learn from their history, which shows that the organizations that became sustainable did so by leveraging their already-existing strengths.\nThe first step down the path of creating a sustainably funded organization involves acknowledging that many of the positions outlined in PSA policies are best served, not as volunteer positions, but as paid positions. We must also acknowledge that the costs of paying for this labor may be high. If we assume that all 29,900 hours are paid, and paid at even a very low wage ($7.25/hour, or US minimum wage), we still get a labor cost of at least $216,775 per year. This does not consider taxes, vacation, or other overhead. \nOf course, it may not be necessary to pay for all 29,900 hours, either because our staffing estimates are inaccurate, or because our labor becomes more efficient when we switch to a paid model. Yet the mere act of thinking through these considerations requires recognizing that the PSA’s maximalist vision has a financial cost.\nWhat we can be is constrained by our ability to obtain resources\nThe vision of the PSA outlined in its founding documents is grand. If implemented successfully, this vision could have an impact on psychology that is transformative, creating a science that is more inclusive, more collaborative, more transparent, and more robust.\nYet the PSA cannot realize this vision of itself for free. Currently, the PSA attempts to be a maximalist institution on a minimalist budget. That has worked during the PSA’s early years, but such a model may not be sustainable long-term. If we wish to implement a maximal vision for the PSA, we will need to focus dedicated energy into obtaining the funding needed for this implementation. As we will describe in a follow-up post, this will likely require developing funding streams outside of the traditional grant mechanisms to which scientists are accustomed.\n---\nFunding Note: Patrick Forscher is paid via a French National Research Agency “Investissements d’avenir” program grant (ANR-15-IDEX-02) at Université Grenoble Alpes awarded to Hans IJzerman."

Instead of using the PSA network to achieve an international sample, this study focused on a hard-to-reach study population: Black American college students. Compared to previous studies, the project was also unusually applied-facing, as it focused on a theory that was developed to understand, and hopefully address, performance gaps in settings like college where strong performance could affect a person’s life trajectory.\nThe proposed project aimed to address potential weaknesses in the evidence for the theory while simultaneously demonstrating how we can use big team science to achieve the sample sizes needed for informative quantitative tests of theories about hard-to-reach populations. The budding PSA network saw merit in this project, and at least one journal has agreed, as the project was accepted in principle as a Registered Report at Nature Human Behaviour.\nFour years later and data collection is going strong. As of October 31, 2022, we have recruited 1025 Black college students into our project. This is a stunning accomplishment, and already puts our project among the largest ever studies of stereotype threat among Black American college students. This accomplishment has only been possible due to financial contributions from the project leadership team, which we have redistributed to data collection labs to defray the costs of participant recruitment.\nHowever, 1025 is still short of our goal of a minimum of 2000 participants. We now believe we need crowdfunding to reach our data collection goal.\nYou can donate to this project here. Any donations we receive that exceed our financial need will be donated to the PSA at project’s end, as we have relied heavily on PSA resources to make this project happen.\nHelp us finish an amazing – and, for psychology, historic – project, further demonstrating the potential of big team science for solving some of behavioral science’s most pressing problems.\n\n- The PSA Stereotype Thread administrative team"

Called the Secondary Analysis Challenge, this initiative started from the premise that much of the potential richness in psychological datasets is currently untapped.\nThe Challenge aimed to tap that richness using two methods. The first method was relatively standard: we created extensive documentation of the project data and meta-data. The second method was a bit more unusual: we provided incentives to research teams who were willing to follow an analysis pipeline that we thought would minimize the chance of false positives and maximize the chance of true discoveries.\nSpecifically, with the help of a generous donation out of Hans Rocha IJzerman’s book income, we were able to offer $200 awards to up to 10 teams that:"

Each submission consisted of a link to a preregistered script that conducted an analysis on the exploratory segment of the PSA001 data.\nTwo members of our team (Abigail Noyce and Patrick Forscher) checked the submitted scripts for computational reproducibility. These checks involved running the submitted analysis script on one of our computers. We focused primarily on ensuring that the scripts ran without error, but we also sometimes commented on other issues, such as unusual parameter estimates, and possible bugs. We did not comment at all on the validity or theoretical grounding of the analyses. In most cases we did not even have access to this information.\nIf the computational reproducibility check led to changes in the code, we asked the submitting teams to add a comment to the top of the revised script listing the changes. These revised scripts were uploaded to the project OSF page.\nAfter these computational reproducibility checks, we released the confirmatory segment of the data. We asked the teams to use the revised scripts to analyze the confirmatory segment. To receive the award, the proposing team also had to write a brief preprint reporting the results to PsyArXiv. We did not give any strong requirements on the contents of these preprints; we merely asked that they be made public.\nCarlota Batres, one of our Challenge participants, mentioned specifically that the Challenge structure provided her with opportunities she would not otherwise have had. “I hope there will be more initiatives like this one which leverage the collaborative power of the PSA,” she commented."

    "text": "What are the preprints like?\nMost, but not all, of the preprints rely on connecting the PSA001 face rating data to some other secondary dataset, such as the Chicago Face Database, the Project Implicit Demo Website datasets, or the UN Migration database. Aside from that similarity, the preprints varied substantially in structure, format, and content. Some are fairly brief descriptions of results. Some are submission-ready articles with publication-quality figures. The topics range from an investigation of the “halo effect” to the possible link between face perception and the race and gender IAT scores averaged across regions. The Challenge seems to have elicited a variety of submissions that bear on a variety of scientific topics.\nWe think the preprints cover many interesting topics. However, no one within the PSA reviewed the preprints themselves for scientific veracity. You can help ensure that we advance science through this exercise by looking through the preprints yourself and providing comments and feedback to the authors. To facilitate this process, we have included links and descriptions of the preprints at the end of this post."

    "text": "Lessons for Future Challenges\nWe think this Challenge was a success. The Challenge also holds some lessons for people who wish to facilitate their own, similar, initiatives:\n\nCommunicate a clear schedule. Clarity of communication helps keep the Challenge process predictable for the participants.\nConduct computational reproducibility checks. The computational reproducibility checks were effortful. I estimate that I spent at least an hour and a half per submission, including running code, debugging, and communicating with submitters. However, the checks uncovered multiple issues and sometimes led to substantive revisions to the analysis plan. These checks were effortful but worthwhile.\nEnrich the target dataset with meta-data. Meta-data are data about the data -- in other words, the time of data collection, information about the stimuli, and other details about the data collection process. These meta-data are important for primary studies, but are crucial for secondary analyses. In this Challenge, we archived a huge amount of meta-data alongside our primary data and documented these in our data management plan. These meta-data greatly facilitated the task of generating interesting exploratory analyses.\nBuild pipelines to other datasets. The extensive documentation of the PSA001 data made it easy to merge our dataset to other interesting datasets. In fact, we included Chicago Face Database ID variables in the data that we released and explicitly noted in our data management plan how to merge our data to the Chicago Face Database. This is another step that we took that, I think, allowed the Challenge to be generative for exploratory analysis.\n\nOur Challenge format should not be viewed as a substitute for other forms of peer review. By design, the Challenge did not evaluate the merits of the theoretical logic, the analysis plan, or criteria for inference. Hopefully, these are issues that peer reviewers evaluate if and when these proposals are submitted for consideration at scientific journals.\nOverall, we view the Challenge format as a promising supplement that can enhance the scientific value of large datasets. We look forward to observing other innovations people adopt to enhance the value of psychological data."

    "text": "Appendix: Secondary Analysis Challenge Preprints\n\nPreprint 1: PSA001 Secondary Analysis:\nExamining the “attractiveness halo effect”\nAuthors: Carlota Batres\nAbstract: Research has found that attractiveness has a positive “halo effect”, where physically attractive individuals are ascribed with socially desirable personality traits. Most of the research on this “attractiveness halo effect”, however, has been conducted using Western samples. Therefore, this report aims to examine the “attractiveness halo effect” across eleven world regions using thirteen ratings on faces, including attractiveness, that the Psychological Science Accelerator network collected. We found that for both male and female faces, attractiveness generally correlated positively with the socially desirable traits and negatively with the socially undesirable traits. More specifically, across all eleven world regions, individuals rated as more attractive were rated as more confident, emotionally stable, intelligent, responsible, sociable, and trustworthy as well as less weird. These results replicate previous findings of the “attractiveness halo effect” in Western samples and suggest that the positive effect of attractiveness can be found cross-culturally.\n\n\nPreprint 2: Is facial width-to-height\nratio reliably associated with social inferences? A large cross-national examination\nAuthors: Patrick Durkee and Jessica Ayers\nAbstract: Previous research suggests that facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR) may be associated with behavioral tendencies and social judgments. Mounting evidence against behavioral links, however, has led some researchers to invoke evolutionary mismatch to explain fWHR-based inferences. To examine whether such an explanation is needed, we leveraged a large cross-national dataset containing ratings of 120 faces on 13 fundamental social traits by raters across 11 world regions (N = 11,481). In the results of our preregistered analyses, we found mixed evidence for fWHR-based social judgments. Men’s fWHR was not reliably linked to raters’ judgments for any of the 13 trait inferences. In contrast, women’s fWHR was reliably negatively associated with raters’ judgments of how dominant, trustworthy, sociable, emotionally stable, responsible, confident, attractive, and intelligent women appeared, and positively associated with how weird women appeared. Because these findings do not follow from assumptions and theory guiding fWHR research, the underlying theoretical framework may need revising.\n\n\nPreprint 3: Variance & Homogeneity of\nFacial Trait Space Across World Regions [PSA001 Secondary Data Analysis]\nAuthors: Sally Xie and Eric Hehman\nAbstract: This preregistration is part of the PSA secondary analysis challenge. We investigate how the facial 'trait space' shifts across countries and world regions, using the PSA_001 dataset shared by the Psychological Science Accelerator. The facial trait space refers to the interrelationships between many of the trait impressions that people infer from faces. Here, we examine whether this trait space is more homogeneous (or less differentiated) in some cultures than others.\n\n\nPreprint 4: Hester PSA001\nPreregistration Preprint—Region- and Language-Level ICCs for Judgments of Faces\nAuthors: Neil Hester and Eric Hehman\nAbstract: We report the results of preregistered analyses of the PSA001 face perception data. We tested whether the target-level intra-class correlations (ICCs) would be higher in specific regions (i.e., more culturally homogeneous samples) than in the global data set (i.e., a less culturally homogeneous sample). We also report perceiver-level ICCs as well as by-trait perceiver- and target-level ICCs.\n\n\nPreprint 5: Do regional gender and\nracial biases predict gender and racial biases in social face judgments?\nAuthors: DongWon Oh and Alexander Todorov\nAbstract: Trait impressions from faces are more simplified for women than men. This bias stems from gender stereotypes; when strong stereotypes exist for a group of faces (e.g., of women’s or Blacks’), they are evaluated more positively/negatively when they fit/violate the stereotypes, making the impressions simpler (i.e., more one-dimensional). In this preregistered study, using trait impression ratings of faces collected from various world regions (+11,000 participants in 48 countries), scores of implicit associations (+18,000 and +212,000 participants in +200 countries), and mixed-effects models, we ask (1) whether simplified facial impressions are found for women and Blacks across regions and (2) whether the regional level of stereotypes about genders and races is correlated with the level of simplification in the face-based impressions of women and Blacks, respectively. The results were not coherent across analyses. The interpretation of the results and the limitations of the study are discussed.\n\n\nPreprint 6: Hierarchical Modelling of\nFacial Perceptions: A Secondary Analysis of Aggressiveness Ratings\nAuthors: Mark Adkins, Nataly Beribisky, Stefan Bonfield, and Linda Farmus\nAbstract: The Psychological Science Accelerator’s (PSA) primary project tested for latent structure using exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis but we decided to diverge from this approach and model individual traits separately. Our interest mainly was in examining the interplay between “stimulus ethnicity” and “stimulus sex” to discover how differing levels of these criterion differ across region, country, lab etc. While the necessary and prerequisite hierarchical structural information about each trait could certainly be found within the primary project’s dataset, we did not assume that any specific factor structure from the PSA’s primary analysis would necessarily hold, therefore we based our decision to model the data from each trait separately using a mixed model framework.\n\n\nPreprint 7: Population diversity is\nassociated with trustworthiness impressions from faces\nAuthors: Jared Martin, Adrienne Wood, and DongWon Oh\nAbstract: People infer a number of traits about others’ based simply on facial appearance. Even when inaccurate, face-based trait impressions can have important behavioral consequences including voting behavior and criminal sentencing. Thus, understanding how perceivers infer others’ traits is an important social and psychological issue. Recent evidence suggests that face-based trait impressions may vary by culture. In the present work, we attempt to understand cultural differences in face-based trait impressions. As part of the Psychological Science Accelerator’s Secondary Data Analysis Challenge, we report a set of pre-registered analyses testing how cultural differences in present-day diversity relate to a) 13 face-based trait impressions, b) sensitivity to physical features of the face, c) and the mental structure underlying trait impressions. We find that greater present-day diversity might be related to lower trustworthiness ratings, in particular. We discuss this finding in the context of other recent work and suggest further analysis of the mental structure of face-based trait impressions across cultures.\n\n\nPreprint 8: The Facial Width-to-Height\nRatio (fWHR) and Perceived Dominance and Trustworthiness: Moderating Role of Social Identity Cues (Gender and Race) and Ecological Factor (Pathogen Prevalence)\nAuthors: Subramanya Prasad Chandrashekar\nAbstract: People effortlessly form trait impressions from faces, and these impressions can affect a variety of important social and economic outcomes. Trait impressions based on facial features can be approximated to distinct dimensions: trustworthiness and dominance (Oosterhof & Todorov, 2008). One of the facial features, the facial width-to-height ratio (face ratio) is associated with the trait impressions. I tested whether social category (gender, race) of the target being perceived shapes the relationship between face ratio and perception of dominance and trustworthiness. In this preregistered study, using trait impression ratings of faces collected from 8800 participants across 44 countries, I employ mixed-effects analysis and report results on (1) the direct influence of social categories (gender and race) of the target on perceived dominance and trustworthiness, (2) the moderating role of social categories (gender and race) on the direct relationships between face ratio and perceived dominance and trustworthiness, and (3) the moderating role of pathogen prevalence on the direct relationships between face ratio and perceived dominance and trustworthiness."

    "text": "Opportunity is distributed unequally in human affairs. Science is a human affair, so this dictum applies to science as it applies to any other human endeavor. At the PSA we recognize this as an unfortunate current characteristic of science, but we also think that science will be both fairer and of higher quality if opportunity were distributed more evenly. Working toward this aspiration is central to our core principles. However, we have some ways to go to meet it: of the over 500 labs that have joined our network, only 14% were in South and Central America, 5% in Eastern Europe, 6% in the Middle East, 4% in Asia, and 1% in Africa. Last year, we started an initiative to move us closer to our aspiration: we issued three small grants of $400 to under-resourced labs PSA labs. These grants helped these labs collect data and earn authorship on one of our studies. This year, we are continuing this program. While the exact number of grants we will be able to issue is uncertain, we hope to issue six grants of $400 each to PSA labs that wish to collect data for one of our studies. These grants will be funded using money collected from our Patreon if we meet our support goal (see this previous post for more details). We will select recipients based on the following two criteria:\n\nDemonstrated need. We define “need” to mean that the data collection could not happen without the provision of the grant. As an additional provision, and as an attempt to improve lab representation from non-Western countries, at least three of the grants will go to labs from those regions.\nBenefit to the PSA study in question. We will prioritize labs that provide a unique benefit to the PSA study in which they are participating. For example, in a study of how a psychological process varies across cultures, we will prioritize labs that allow the recruitment of participants from a culture that is not already represented in the study.\n\nOur current crop of accepted studies deal with topics ranging from language comprehension, to stereotype threat, to moral decision-making. Five of these six studies (002 through 006) are actively recruiting labs. We also have an active call for studies that ends September 15, 2019 that will give us a new wave of studies covering yet more topics. This provides prospective labs with the opportunity to join studies, and earn authorship on manuscripts, that match their interests. If you are interested in applying for one of these grants, fill out this form. We hope this initiative will play a small but measurable role in redistributing scientific opportunities in a fairer way."

Even in the Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA), African participation in multi-site studies has been poor, with a recent project including just two (out of several thousand) African indigenous languages. To facilitate inclusion and improve generalizability of psychology, we propose a paid translation service for African languages and thereafter offer a more general translation service (for full details regarding this service, see here).\nWho could use this service? Any researcher interested in conducting research amongst African populations.\nWhat do I stand to benefit? First, users would get a high-quality translation. Quality of these translations is of high priority and we intend to adopt the already established translation procedures of the PSA. This procedure required a forward translation (source to targeted language), a back translation (serving as validation), editing (reconciling text difference of first version and validation version), external reading (feedback from potential respondents), cultural adjustment, proofreading, and implementation (transfer of translated note into a survey software). Second, such a translation service allows one to conduct research in African populations as we will also try to connect users with local researchers.\nSurvey. We invite you to give us feedback on this proposed service via this short (5 minute) survey (if you are instead interested in being a translator, you can fill in the survey here)."

Proposals should not exceed 1 page. This one page should include the basic research question, (very briefly) the relevant literature, identify whether the research is exploratory or confirmatory, and how the research will contribute to reducing the effects of the current crisis. If confirmatory, the researchers should clearly identify the hypothesis/hypotheses and the needed sample size for answering their research question. If exploratory, the researchers should identify how data will be used to generate hypotheses. In addition, if exploratory, the researchers will have to identify how they will use methods including - but not limited to - cross-validation for greater certainty about the generated ideas. If feasible and volunteers are available, the network may be able to assist with translation into the major world languages. However, if you need your study conducted in multiple languages, we encourage you to have a translation plan in place."

    "title": "Update on the Accelerated CREP. A Collaborative CREP Replication Project Powered by the PSA",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Last year, the Collaborative Replications and Education Project (CREP; pronounced like grape) and the Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA) partnered on a project, now referred to as the Accelerated CREP (or PSA 004 Justified True Belief). The mission of the Accelerator is to accelerate the accumulation of reliable and generalizable evidence in psychological science, while the mission of the CREP is to improve undergraduate training through crowdsourced replication. Over the course of the last year, the CREP and PSA networks have worked together to collaboratively fulfill these two parallel missions by putting together a registered replication report (RRR), now provisionally accepted at Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science (AMPPS; preprint here: psyarxiv.com/zeux9). The purpose of the Accelerated CREP is to harness the power of undergraduate research projects across five continents to address the need for replication in the field of Psychological Science. Having students perform replications as part of their psychological science education serves both as a pedagogical tool for teaching junior researchers about open science and as a rigorous scientific method for collecting high quality, transparent data for a field in need of corroboration. When we first began this project, we didn't know whether we would simply preregister the study or attempt to publish it as a registered report. However, after writing a short proposal to AMPPS for the project, we were invited in June of 2018 to submit our study plan as a full Stage 1 registered replication report (RRR). After several months of writing, planning, and R coding multilevel data simulations and power analyses, we submitted our collaborative study plan in November 2018. In January 2019, AMPPS requested that we resubmit our paper with revisions that considerably improved the study plan. After making these revisions and other improvements, our team resubmitted the paper back to AMPPS for review in February 2019. In April 2019, AMPPS requested a few additional changes, which were resubmitted the following month. And in June 2019, the Accelerated CREP Stage 1 RRR was provisionally accepted at AMPPS. A lot of changes have been made to the Accelerated CREP project over the last year since its inception, and many of those changes arose from our decision to publish our plan as a registered report. We originally planned a very simple direct replication, but the AMPPS editor and reviewers made suggestions for how we could improve our design, including testing similar stimuli as a random factor to improve our test's generalizability, adjusting our cross-cultural and covariate analysis plans, and improving our theoretical precision. One of the original authors also suggested that we transition from using a binary response to a scaled response for a more sensitive measure of people's attributions of knowledge. When making all of these changes, it was also important for us to always consider student feasibility against other goals of the study. And, while publishing a registered report considerably delayed our original study timeline, it has no doubt resulted in a much more rigorous, much more fine tuned study from which students can learn. Due to the delays in our study timeline, we decided to allow some sites who had written their curriculum around the replicated Turri, Buckwalter, and Blouw (2015) study to participate in a traditional CREP preregistered direct replication with their students - which can all be found forked off the Accelerated CREP's OSF page. The data from these direct replication studies will not be used for our primary planned multilevel analyses, but they may serve as an interesting comparison to the rest of the study. The first phase of this joint study took a lot of collaboration and planning, so we're eager to begin data collection! See below for more information about how to participate, using SoSciSurvey (and alternatives), CREP procedures, translation procedures, and some open science teaching resources. Survey is Now Live on SoSciSurvey As of July 27th, the universal English version of our main online survey is now live! We will have it open for one week for testing/debugging across all 50+ labs before resetting the data for sites to begin collecting data from participants. Our survey monitor, Sophia Weissgerber, has worked hard to code a universal survey in SoSciSurvey which is now open for contributors to start testing so they can request site specific versions, if they need one. Teams not testing in English will use the PSA procedures to translate the study materials to their local language (all posted to the OSF), and then Sophia will create a language specific version for the study with the help of our translation coordinator, Jan Philipp Röer. By using SoSciSurvey, we are able to provide a boilerplate study experience to all interested labs that is both free and accessible globally (via internet access). We will also work with labs to create specific versions of the survey for those who have more unique needs or who want to run an extension of the study. We will allow sites to use other survey programs/applications; however, all data must conform to our universal data template - which our data monitor, Daniel Dunleavy, will share to the OSF after contributors have finish testing the current version. Each lab’s data collection plan must be cleared by the CREP review team prior to collecting data. Steps to Participate If you and/or your students are interested in participating in our collaborative, student-led project, you will need to take the following steps (this is an abbreviated list, see the CREP step-by-step for more detailed information):\n\nStep 1: Become a member of the PSA\n\nThe PSA is comprised of 760 researchers representing 548 laboratories from 72 countries across 6 continents (see map here).\nYou can join easily by providing your contact info here.\n\nStep 2: Sign up for the Accelerated CREP\n\nFirst, provide us with your information.\n\nIf your site will have more than one team of researchers collecting data concurrently, you should submit just one OSF page for review. We ask that you describe the multiple teams in your OSF page wiki, and clearly identify the materials, methods, data, and results from each team in your files.\n\nThen, someone from the CREP will contact you with more instructions and a project number within two business days.\n\nWe will be tracking some details related to each site's project here.\n\nIn the meantime, please feel free to start working on the CREP step-by-step instructions provided here.\n\nStep 3: Get Ethics/IRB Approval\n\nOnce you are familiar with the CREP procedures and you have been assigned a project number, your next step is to get ethics approval from your institution.\n\nTo help contributors expedite their IRB/Ethics application process, we have provided a template for you to use to fill out your own institution’s ethics application - which can be found here.\n\n\nStep 4: Submitting Protocol for Review\n\nAfter you have received your institutional ethics approval, you and/or your students will submit your lab’s protocol for review to the CREP review team.\n\nTo submit your protocol for review, you will fork your study off the Accelerated CREP parent OSF page to create your lab’s preregistration on the Open Science Framework (OSF).\n\nYour lab’s preregistration will include a written protocol that should match all protocols and procedures set forth in the Stage 1 RRR.\nA video of the methods used for the study.\nYour institutional ethics approval.\n\nThe CREP review team will work with your group to approve your protocol. The goal is approval, no contributors will be denied outright. The review process is just to ensure that your lab understands the study plan entirely.\n\n\nStep 5: Collect Data\n\nAfter the CREP review team has approved your protocol, you will be cleared to collect data.\nOverall data collection will end on June 1st, 2020.\n\nLabs who turn in their data report after this date may not have their data represented in the Stage 2 paper.\n\n\nStep 6: Submit Data\n\nAfter data collection ends or your team reaches its target sample size, your team may submit your data, analysis report, and other information to the CREP for a final review.\nOnce approved, we will collate your data into the aggregate dataset for analysis.\n\nTeams will also post their site level analyses to their preregistered OSF pages.\n\n\n\nAuthorship Requirements and Current Contributions When you sign up to contribute to this study, you must agree to our Collaboration Agreement. If you have any questions/concerns about this agreement, please email me at HallBF@hendrix.edu. Contributors who collect a larger sample (N &gt; 100) and/or collect non-university participants will be given more advanced authorship. Authors can be added to a Registered Replication Report at different stages. Details about stage 1 author contributions can be found in the manuscript in the \"Author Contributions\" section: Preprint: https://psyarxiv.com/zeux9. What constitutes authorship on the final manuscript? All authors must make contributions to writing - review and editing (which involves approval of the submission) and must also make contributions in at least one another category of the CRediT taxonomy (see table below). “Writing - Review and Editing” minimally requires closely reading the full manuscript, providing any relevant feedback and suggested edits, and confirming approval of submission. Most authors will contribute to “Investigation” and “Writing - Review & Editing.” PIs of contributing labs are responsible for their students and staff working on the project. This includes: honestly reporting the contributions of their lab members, evaluating whether contributions merit authorship according to the above paragraph and the CRediT table below, and verifying that contributions are correctly described in any formal publication. PIs are also responsible for showing this agreement to lab members who will be authors and making sure they agree to it. Author contributions will be reported on research products (e.g., the Registered Report submission, the final manuscript) using the CRediT taxonomy.\n\n\n\nCRediT Contributor Roles\n\n\n\n\n#\nRole\nDefinition\n\n\n1\n​Conceptualization\n​Ideas; formulation or evolution of overarching research goals and aims.\n\n\n2\nData curation\nMonitoring activities to annotate (produce metadata), scrub data and maintain research data (including software code, where it is necessary for interpreting the data itself) for initial use and later re-use.\n\n\n3\nFormal analysis\nApplication of statistical, mathematical, computational, or other formal techniques to analyse or synthesize study data.\n\n\n4\nFunding acquisition ​\n​Acquisition of the financial support for the project leading to this publication.\n\n\n5\n​Investigation\n​Conducting a research and investigation process, specifically performing the experiments, or data/evidence collection.\n\n\n6\n​Methodology\n​Development or design of methodology; creation of models.\n\n\n7\nProject administration ​\n​Monitoring and coordination responsibility for the research activity planning and execution.\n\n\n8\n​Resources\n​Provision of study materials, reagents, materials, patients, laboratory samples, animals, instrumentation, computing resources, or other analysis tools.\n\n\n9\n​Software\n​Programming, software development; designing computer programs; implementation of the computer code and supporting algorithms; testing of existing code components.\n\n\n10\n​Supervision\n​Oversight and leadership responsibility for the research activity planning and execution, including mentorship external to the core team.\n\n\n11\n​Validation\n​Verification, whether as a part of the activity or separate, of the overall replication/reproducibility of results/experiments and other research outputs.\n\n\n12\n​Visualization\n​Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work, specifically visualization/data presentation.\n\n\n13\nWriting – original draft ​\n​Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work, specifically writing the initial draft (including substantive translation).\n\n\n14\nWriting – review & editing ​\n​Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work by those from the original research group, specifically critical review, commentary or revision – including pre- or post-publication stages.\n\n\n\nHow will authorship order be determined?

Now we are waiting for the final decision from the editor.\nPSA 002/003- Thanks to the amazing collaboration between Merle Shuckart, Alessandra Souza, and Erin Buchanan we have been able to start getting this study bundle online. If your lab is going to be running the study online, each lab will need to provide an information text to participants signing up explaining the goals, risk, etc.\nPSA 004- Data collection has slowed down as many members' universities have concluded their semesters. We do however need more CREP reviewers as we wrap up this project at the end of the year. CREP reviewers look over each lab's OSF page to ensure that each lab is performing the study as planned. If you or someone else is interested please have them fill out this form.\nPSA 005- The PSA005 team completed its feasibility pilot of the technical implementation of the study. The leadership team then finished its revision to the manuscript and resubmitted this revision to Nature Human Behaviour! COVID-19 has disrupted the data collection timeline, but the leadership has decided to monitor the situation at the start of each semester to determine the safety and feasibility of in-person data collection.\nPSA 006- The PSA 006 project is currently collecting data. So far, the ~150 participating labs have collected data over 8, 000 participants. Following the registered plan, the team is conducting sequential data analyses in three cultural clusters. Further rounds of data collection are expected later this year.\nPSACR 001/002/003- The PSACR bundle is collecting data in 19 languages, and the data collection deadline has been extended through mid-July or longer (we will continue collecting data as long as we can afford to). We are collecting data through PSA member labs and also through several panels. Over 10,000 people have participated so far, meaning that they completed the general questions about the pandemic and one or more of the study surveys.\n\nThank you for all that you have, and continue to do, on behalf of the PSA. Let’s keep accelerating psychological science together!\n-Chris and Savannah"

    "text": "It has been an exciting month for the PSA! You can also stay up to date by subscribing to the blog, following us on twitter, signing up for our email list, or joining our slack workspace. For January, we have updates on peer review decisions for our projects, in-progress studies, and new ways to communicate with PSA leadership and stay informed on our activities.\n\nFavorable peer review decisions!\nWe have just received an in principle acceptance for “Investigating object orientation effects across 14 languages” at Psychonomic Bulletin and Review. Congratulations to Sau-Chin Chen, Anna Szabelska, and all of our co-authors! We will now plan for data collection and share updates soon.  We also recently received a favorable revise and resubmit decision for \"Accelerated CREP: RRR: Turri, Buckwalter, & Blouw (2015)\" at Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science. Braeden Hall and Jordan Wagge have been leading the revision efforts and will resubmit the manuscript soon.\n\n\nLab recruitment for moral thinking study\nWe are recruiting labs for “On the universality of moral thinking: Cross-cultural variation in the influence of personal force and intention in moral dilemma judgments.” The current list of contributing labs is up to 105 sites representing 42 countries! This is a great start, but we still welcome additional labs to join the team. We will likely submit this project as a Registered Report, so the size and diversity of our team will strengthen our Stage 1 submission and chances of securing an in principle acceptance.\n\n\nData collection\nData collection continues for “To which world regions does the valence-dominance model apply.” We have now collected data from over 2,000 participants across 48 labs. More labs and more languages of collection are going \"live\" every day and we will continue the project through September. You can see demo versions of all active languages here.\n\n\nStaying up to date on PSA activities\nWe have started an \"on-deck\" document that summarizes the various active projects and work of the PSA. If you are wondering what activities could use extra person-power or what the leadership team is working on, this document is a great place to look! We will try to make it more detailed and helpful in the coming days, as well as keep it as up to date as possible. Chris will be hosting monthly Q&A sessions for PSA members via google hangouts. If you've been on the \"sidelines\", are not sure how to get more actively involved in the PSA, or have any questions about our policies, processes, or current studies, please join in on an upcoming call to have your questions answered! The times for the meetings will vary considerably from month to month to allow for members from all of our different time zones to have opportunities to join. The first hangout will be Monday, February 25th, 17:00 UTC. You can join the call at this link (which we will also share via twitter just prior to the meeting). One last random note: in the PSA members’ roster spreadsheet, we recently switched all lab IDs to 3 digit ISO codes. Lab IDs that were being used for the faces study are being held constant for use in that specific tracking sheet and data collection process, but we will use the new ISO codes going forward.\n\nThank you for all of the continued efforts you have put into making the PSA a success!\n\n\nChris"

    "text": "WOW… 2020.\nIt has been a wild year for all of us. From quarantine to scheduled grocery visits and walks, we have adapted a lot this past year. I want to wrap up this year by taking some to reflect on all that our network has accomplished.\nThe PSA has been able to successfully implement three new studies in just a few short months. We have added several new initiatives such as the director statements, the first PSA conference, and our most recent blog post about the PSA’s capacity. Along with the achievement of finishing data collection for several of our current studies (PSA 004, PSACR 001/002/003, and PSA 006).\nIt is thanks to all of our members and directors for making this possible. Thank you for continuing to be present in our studies and for your willingness to collaborate. We appreciate all of our PSA members but we want to give a special shoutout to our project teams for their hard work to keep the studies running in a pandemic.\nWe enter the new year with the prospect of new studies and the PSA 001 paper in press!\nStudy updates:\n\nPSA 001- Paper is in-press! It will be published with Nature Human Behavior in January.\nPSA 002/003- The leadership team for the 002/003 bundle of studies has been hard at work, creating an online version of the 002 study protocol that will not rely on in-person data collection. This new protocol was recently approved by the editors of the Psychonomic Bulletin and Review. We are now testing the 002 online link. \nPSA 004- We are no longer taking new teams and we would like data to be collected by the end of the year, with final CREP submissions by the end of January.\nPSA 005- This project is currently on hold until the US gets better control of COVID. \nPSA 006- We are in the last month of data collection for 006!!! Thank you to everyone who has been a part of this process so far. \nPSA 007- PSA007 will be starting on pre-projects after the holidays, please email buchananlab@gmail.com if you are interested in joining.\nPSACR Bundle- The submitting author teams are hard at work analyzing data and writing their manuscript drafts! Meanwhile, we (the admin team) are developing a data management plan (figuring out exactly how and when we will share the data). We also, on an ongoing basis, are working to make sure that everyone’s contributions are accurately documented.\n\nStudy Capacity Policy: \nLast month we voted on the study capacity policy for the PSA. As described in our Study Capacity Policy, study capacity is determined by the PSA’s data collection capacity or the amount and kind of participant data the PSA can collect in a given year, and its administrative capacity, or its ability to perform the administrative tasks required to collect participant data. The study capacity has passed and will go into effect. \nHow many resources does the PSA possess?\nThis blog discusses the PSA’s first study capacity report, which contains a ton of interesting findings of our network. It also addresses the resources that the PSA currently has and will need in the future. Make sure you take a look at this important resource for the PSA. \nThe financial cost of the PSA’s vision.\nWe recently released this blog on describing the need for funding to continue our vision. Patrick Forscher and Hans Ijzerman argue that in order to fulfill a maximalist vision we need to secure funding.\nPSACR hackathon:\nThe admin team for the PSACR projects is hard at work preparing the datasets for release. As part of this process, we held two hack-a-thons to code the free text responses that participants entered about where they were located into more structured and usable location data. We also cross-checked our initial coded responses to ensure that our final dataset is accurate. The work involved sorting through two spreadsheets — one with 2000+ rows and one with a bit less than 200 — and deciding on the meaning of free text that was often incomplete and in non-English languages.\nFortunately, these hack-a-thons were a huge success! We were able to accomplish the work quickly and efficiently. Huge thanks go out to the people who volunteered their time to make this happen, including Biljana Gjoneska, Anna Szabelska, Martin Vasilev, Amélie Gourdon-Kanhukamwe, Jen Beaudry, and Niels van Berkel. Thanks also go out to the hardworking members of the admin team who prepped, facilitated, and administered the hack and its resulting data, including Erin Buchanan, Hannah Moshontz, and Patrick Forscher.\nClinical Chapter\nWe recently wrote a chapter about how our network might help with clinical research for an upcoming book on questionable research practices (and solutions) in clinical psychology. We think there's potential to explore important clinical questions with the PSA! Check it out here!\nCoffee Station Channel on Slack:\nIn a physical office, you would have a coffee station or a place where you can take a break and refresh with your co-workers. The coffee station often becomes a place where you can share about what is going on in your life and a place to just take a break from your busy work schedule. We want to be able to get to know more people in our vast network. Therefore, Savannah decided to create a virtual coffee station. We will be using this channel to get to know each other and possibly host some fun coffee hangouts. Head over to slack to check out the coffee station. \n\n\nHappy Holidays! 🎉 We look forward to working with you in the new year!\nSavannah"

This puts a bow on the PSA’s first empirical project. Congratulations to the whole study team for this enormous accomplishment. You can read some reflections from the leadership team of the project on the Nature blog. \nPSA 002/003- The leadership team for the 002/003 bundle of studies has been hard at work, creating an online version of the 002 study protocol that will not rely on in-person data collection.

This summer, we’ll evaluate whether in-person data collection is likely to be feasible in fall 2021.\nPSA 006- Final analyses are being completed and the manuscript is being written.\nPSA 007- We are putting together the website for people to get started on this project. As soon as that is finished we will send out the onboarding email.

We also, on an ongoing basis, are working to make sure that everyone’s contributions are accurately documented.\n\n\n\nChris Farewell:\nThis past month we received news that Chris Chartier has resigned from his role as PSA Director. Chris guided the PSA from an idea to a vibrant organization with more than 1400 members. Although he will no longer be the PSA’s director, he may yet transition into a different PSA role. In the meantime, Charlie Ebersole will serve as acting Director of the PSA and we will begin the process of holding an election for a new Director. \nBelow you will find Chris’s farewell message to the PSA. \n“I can’t wait to watch, and support, the PSA through this transition and into the next chapter of it’s growth. I'm a bit sad to step away from this role, because it has been such a personal joy to serve in this way, but I'm also very excited to see all the amazing things the PSA will accomplish with a new Director who can give the organization the energy, attention, and care it deserves. \nI've enjoyed working with each and every one of you immensely. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for making these last 3 and a half years of my life so special and meaningful. It's a period of my life that I will always cherish and look back on fondly. I won't be disappearing from the PSA of course, but I'm not yet sure what my next role/type of contribution will be.\nAs for the practical matters of this transition, Charlie Ebersole will serve as Interim Director until the Associate Directors group can complete an election process for the new Director (thank you, Charlie!!).\nOnward!”\n\n\nAppointments and Elections:\nThe PSA will be replacing several of its leadership positions in the coming months.  Below is a quick rundown of each.\n\nAssistant Directors\nThe Assistant Director positions are replaced by appointment of the Associate Directors. We have openings for positions in the following six committees:\n\nFunding\nEthics\nCommunity Building and Network Expansion\nData and Methods\nTraining\nTranslation and Cultural Diversity\n\nAfter January 30th, the Acting Director and the Associate Directors will select the new Assistant Directors from among the nominees.. If you have any questions about this application or this process, contact the Acting Director, Charlie Ebersole, at cebersole@virginia.edu. .\n\n\nDirector and Associate Director\nThis Spring, the PSA will be electing a new Director and one Associate Director. These positions will be filled by a direct election from the PSA network. Any PSA member may run for these positions. \nLater this month, the PSA leadership will solicit nominations (self or others) for these roles and we plan to conduct the election process over the next two months. If you have any questions about the election process or what’s involved in the positions, contact the Acting Director, Charlie Ebersole, at cebersole@virginia.edu.\n\n\n\nReflections on funding the PSA\nFunding lead Patrick Forscher and Associate Director Hans IJzerman published a blog reflecting on how to fund the PSA. This blog follows up on two previous blogs, one that reflects on the PSA’s resources for running studies, and a second that reflects on the financial cost of the PSA’s vision for itself.\nThe new blog lays out the makings of a funding strategy for the PSA. It lays out four possible sources of future funding: grant writing, charitable giving, fees-for-service, and membership fees, and weighs the strengths and weaknesses of each possibility. The blog also contains two surveys to solicit member feedback about the ideas within the blog.\nThis is an important post, as it concerns the future of the PSA. If you are interested in shaping the PSA’s strategy for financial sustainability, please give it a read."

    "text": "The PSACR Administrative Leadership Team\nHeather Urry, Hannah Moshontz, Charles Ebersole, Jeremy K. Miller,\nNicholas Coles, Maximilian Primbs, Erin Buchanan, Patrick S. Forscher\nOn March 13, 2020, the PSA put out a call for rapid and impactful studies on the psychological aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of the call was to initiate the PSA’s COVID-Rapid Project, or PSACR, which would test whether our “big team science” model of massively collaborative psychology could contribute to a psychological understanding of the pandemic.\nNow, a year and a quarter later, PSACR is bearing its first fruit. The scope of the project is staggering. According to our project methods, our project produced three core studies, a general health behavior survey, a dataset spanning over 47,000 participants and 44 languages and dialects in 110 countries, with a team of 467 collaborators. Moreover, we produced all these products on a budget of a bit less than $17,000 USD – of which $7,000 was donated by PSA members.\nJust as impressive were the hurdles we had to overcome to produce these results. We obtained ethics approval across all our data collection sites, a process that involved huge administrative back-and-forth. We coordinated a translation team of at least 268, who completed forward translation, backward translation, and cultural adjustment processes. We coordinated 18 lab grants and the purchase of 15 semi-representative panels. We maintained two servers for data collection, programmed the project in 44 languages in formr, and completed a massive process of debugging. To maintain quality control, we coordinated a process of internal review before executing the project and revision processes when writing the papers that communicated the results.\nWe believe that our scientific results justify this massive effort. Our project has produced three highly precise and global tests of questions that are both theoretically and practically important. Moreover, we have produced a huge array of project materials in 44 languages, as well as a massive, meticulously documented dataset ripe for secondary analysis. We hope our three core studies are the first of many scientific contributions that PSACR will produce and inspire.\nNone of these achievements would have been possible without the PSA’s most valuable resource, its members. PSA members gave freely and generously of their skills and resources to make this project happen. Moreover, given that the author lists for these projects exceed 400, they did so knowing that they might not receive adequate compensation for their effects in the currency that most matters in academia, credit.\nWe list the main materials of the PSACR project below. Below that, we profile five contributors to this project. We chose these contributors to highlight people from different countries and project roles – and especially some of our many stellar contributors who are early in their careers. Although we do not have space to profile all 467 of our contributors, we hope this does something to make visible some of the many invisible contributions to the PSACR project."

It also provides an opportunity to test theories about risk communication. As part of a larger Psychological Science Accelerator COVID-19 Rapid Project, a global consortium of researchers will experimentally test competing hypotheses regarding the effects of framing messages in terms of losses versus gains. We will examine effects on three primary outcomes: intentions to adhere to policies designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19, opinions about such policies, and the likelihood that participants seek additional policy information. Whereas research on negativity bias and loss aversion predicts that loss-framing will have greater impact, research on encouraging the adoption of protective health behaviour suggests the opposite (i.e., gain-framing will be more persuasive). We will also assess effects on experienced anxiety. Given the potentially low cost and the scalable nature of framing interventions, results could be valuable to health organizations, policymakers, and news sources globally.\n\n\nPSACR Study 002 Reappraisal (preprint; OSF)\nA global test of brief reappraisal interventions on emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic\nAbstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has increased negative emotions and decreased positive emotions globally. Left unchecked, these emotional changes might have a wide array of adverse impacts. To reduce negative emotions and increase positive emotions, we tested the effectiveness of reappraisal, an emotion regulation strategy which modifies how one thinks about a situation. Participants from 87 countries/regions (N = 21,644) were randomly assigned to one of two brief reappraisal interventions (reconstrual or repurposing) or one of two control conditions (active or passive). Results revealed that both reappraisal interventions (vs. both control conditions) had consistent effects in reducing negative emotions and increasing positive emotions across different measures. Reconstrual and repurposing had similar effects. Importantly, planned exploratory analyses indicated that reappraisal interventions did not reduce intentions to practice preventive health behaviours. The findings demonstrate the viability of creating scalable, low-cost interventions for use around the world to build resilience during the pandemic and beyond.\n\n\nPSACR Study 003 Self Determination (preprint currently under revision; OSF)\nA Global Experiment on Motivating Social Distancing during the COVID-19 Pandemic\nAbstract: Finding communication strategies that can effectively motivate social distancing continues to be a global public health priority during the COVID-19 pandemic as people around the world wait to be vaccinated. This cross-country preregistered experiment (n=25,718 from 89 countries) tested hypotheses concerning generalizable positive and negative outcomes of different motivational messages encouraging social distancing that either promoted personal agency (i.e., autonomy supportive), or pressured people with shaming and blaming tactics (i.e., controlling). Participants were randomly assigned to three conditions: an autonomy-supportive message promoting reflective choices, a controlling message that was restrictive and shaming, or no message, which functioned to capture the real-life communications participants had been receiving. Results partially supported experimental hypotheses: the controlling message elicited more defiance relative to the autonomy-supportive message and increased controlled motivation (engaging in social distancing out of guilt and fear of social consequences) relative to no message, but messages did not influence behavioral intentions. Additionally, motivation to engage in social distancing out of guilt and fear of consequences correlated with more defiance and less long-term behavioral intentions to engage in social distancing, whereas motivation to engage in social distancing out of a true understanding of why the rules are important and necessary yielded the opposite patterns. Overall, this work highlights the potential harm of using shaming and pressuring language in public health communication."

    "text": "Profiles of PSACR Contributors\n\nMiguel Silan\nMiguel Silan is a researcher in the Philippines affiliated with the University of the Philippines Diliman. He is working to organize the local methodological community to adopt the methods reforms and tackle the various issues of the credibility crisis.\n\n\n\nMigs is a long-time contributor to the PSA, first as a member of the Translation and Cultural Diversity committee, and more recently as the new Assistant Director of the Community Building and Network Expansion Committee (CBNEC). With the committee, he has co-organized the monthly PSA coffee hours, Slack engagement threads, the onboarding/welcome channel and is currently organizing a more targeted recruitment of PSA members in world regions that are under-represented in current memberships. With PSA working groups, he is also planning to establish an accessible expertise sharing within the PSA (“The Hub”) and to establish regional support groups that aims to increase culture sensitive and culturally specific research approaches. In the past Migs organized no less than three sessions for PSACON2020 and has been a frequent contributor on topics related to translation and measurement in different cultural contexts. For PSACR, Migs helped lead the development of the health behavior survey that accompanied the three core PSACR studies and was the language-wide coordinator for the Filipino versions of the PSACR project. \n\n\nBiljana Gjoneska\nBiljana is a Research Associate at the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts. She has a passion for multinational studies and has participated in eight, four of which were PSA projects. Biljana also loves truly global initiatives like the PSA, where she strives to increase the visibility of her beautifully weird and non-WEIRD country (North Macedonia) in the domains of social psychology and social neuroscience.\n\n\n\nBiljana is a more recent member of the PSA but has nevertheless been an extremely active contributor. She has participated in numerous PSA-sponsored hack-a-thons, including one on the PSA’s study selection process at PSACON2020. At PSACON2020, she presented a concept for auction of studies, that may help facilitate discussions and decision-making processes for preselection of PSA proposals. Her cumulative experiences with the PSA community inspired her to contribute to the PSA as one of its leaders; she was recently appointed as an Assistant Director on the PSA’s Ethics Committee. For PSACR, Biljana was the language-wide coordinator for Macedonian, for which she managed a team of five to complete the forward translations, backward translations, and cultural adjustments of our three core studies and the health behavior survey. Bilijana also contributed to the coding of location data for the general dataset; these data serve as the basis for the focal inferences in the three core studies.\n\n\nİlker Dalgar\nİlker is an Assistant Professor at Ankara Medipol University. He is also working on co-founding the Turkey Open Science Initiative, which aims to promote open and robust research practices, facilitate big team science, and facilitate discussion of and training related to research issues in Turkey.\n\n\n\nİlker has been a long-time contributor to the PSA as an Assistant Director of the Translation and Cultural Diversity Committee. In this role, İlker helped develop the PSA’s translation procedures and standards, which have by now been implemented in nine PSA studies. İlker has also led or assisted with three PSA-themed grant proposals, all focused around increasing the participation from researchers in world regions currently underrepresented in the PSA network. For PSACR, İlker served as the language-wide coordinator for Turkish, managing a team of thirteen to complete forward and backward translations, as well as cultural adjustments, for all three core studies and our health behavior survey.\n\n\nMaximilian Primbs\nMax is finishing his Research Master’s in Behavioural Science. In fall, 2021, Max will begin a PhD at Radboud University, the Netherlands, where he will study situational models of implicit bias.\n\n\n\nEven though Max joined the PSACR project very early in his career, he shouldered a huge responsibility as the project’s primary translation coordinator. For a project involving 44 languages, three primary studies, and a health behavior survey, as well as a translation team of at least 268 people, this was an enormous responsibility. The translation procedure was also more involved than is typical for many projects, involving separate forward translation, backward translation, and cultural adjustment stages. Max rose to the occasion, ensuring this massive task got done in a timely way and assisting team members with troubleshooting when issues inevitably arose. This huge responsibility whet Max’s appetite for “big team science”; Max ran for and won a seat as an Assistant Director of the Translation and Cultural Diversity Committee and has helped organize two PSA-themed conference submissions.\n\n\nSavannah Lewis\nSavannah was a long-time research assistant in Chris Chartier’s lab. She has now transitioned into an Assistant Director position at the Ashland University International Collaborative Research Center. She will soon be looking for PhD programs, likely starting in 2022. \n\n\n\nSavannah was among the PSA’s first crop of interns. She has been the invisible glue holding the PSA together, safeguarding the PSA’s transition into a full-fledged organization. She has done everything from organizing the PSA’s first conference, PSACON2020, to running the PSA’s newsletters, to administering PSA004 Accelerated CREP. For the PSACR projects, Savannah assisted with general administration and technical implementation. In these capacities, she helped manage the master spreadsheet that tracked general project progress and the complex web of interlocking spreadsheets and software that transformed the 44 language versions of the PSACR project into 44 functioning formr surveys."

    "text": "Patrick Forscher, Lisa DeBruine, Ben Jones, Jess Flake, Nick Coles, Chris Chartier\n\nPlease cite this blog post as: Forscher, P. S., DeBruine, L. M., Jones, B. C., Flake, J. K., Coles, N. A., & Chartier, C. R. (2019, September 1). Introducing the PSA001 Secondary Analysis Challenge. https://psysciacc.org/2019/09/01/introducing-the-psa001-secondary-analysis-challenge/\nWe are offering up to 10 awards of $200 to research teams that use data from our first study (PSA001) to follow an analysis pipeline meeting our specifications. We describe the background, rationale, and details below. Background Psychology datasets contain a wealth of information, including dozens, hundreds, and sometimes even thousands of variables. Datasets that are well-documented can be even richer, as appropriate documentation can allow these datasets to be merged with secondary information (or meta-data), exponentially expanding the universe of possible analyses. Although some researchers use publicly posted data in their research, we believe the potential of secondary analyses is, as yet, untapped. Some of this untapped potential may result from the typical structure of a psychology dataset release. In the best case, the dataset is described in an article in a journal (such as the Journal of Open Psychology Data or Scientific Data). In the worst, the dataset is undocumented and only available on request (if at all). We believe we can do better to make our datasets maximally informative. Phased dataset release (with incentives) Our test case for innovating with improving the data release process is PSA001, a project to test whether the valence-dominance model of face perception generalizes across world regions. The primary dataset contains ratings from over 11,000 participants across 11 world regions, 48 countries, and 28 languages. Each participant rated 120 faces twice on one of 13 traits. In addition to these ratings, we have access to datasets containing various meta-data. These include datasets of participant characteristics (such as race and gender – some locations only), site characteristics (such as world region and institutional affiliation), and characteristics of the faces that were rated (such as the gender of the face, picture luminance, and the size of various facial features). In our release of this dataset, we are following the lead of other high quality data releases by carefully curating and documenting our datasets. However, we are adding an extra innovation: we are structuring the release in a way that we think will maximize the value of the resulting secondary analyses. Specifically, we are releasing separate exploratory and confirmatory segments of the data and incentivizing the use of these separate segments by offering up to 10 awards of $200 to research teams who complete the analysis pipeline of exploring with the exploratory segment, confirming with the confirmatory segment, and sharing the results on PsyArXiv. The details The data release plan for this project consists of three phases: release of a simulated dataset (to allow people not directly involved in the project time to understand the variables we collected), release of an exploratory segment (⅓ of the full dataset), and release of a confirmatory segment (the full dataset). We will stratify by lab when creating our exploratory and confirmatory segments; in other words, we will randomly sample ⅓ of the participants within each lab that contributed data to create the exploratory segment. The full dataset will demarcate the exploratory and confirmatory All data drops will occur at randomly selected UTC times between 12am and 11pm. We will provide up to 10 awards of $200 each for research teams that make secondary contributions from the exploratory and confirmatory datasets. If more than 10 teams submit contributions the winners will be chosen at random. To be eligible, a research team must:\n\nWrite a computationally reproducible script that analyzes the exploratory dataset. The script may be written in any data analysis software, but we strongly encourage the use of open-source software such as R.\nPost the script to a project on the Open Science Framework and create a date-stamped preregistration of the script using OSF preregistrations. The proposing teams can use a preregistration template, such as this one for secondary data analysis, or they can use an open-ended preregistration that only contains the script that the team will use to analyze the confirmatory segment and a date stamp. At the top of the script, the proposing team should write their names and the following text: “I commit to analyzing the confirmatory segment of PSA001 Social Faces using this script upon the project’s release”. The date stamp of the preregistration must be before 12pm UTC, November 30, 2019, which is the point at which the confirmatory segment will be released. The script will be checked for computational reproducibility by a member of the PSA’s Data and Methods Committee.\nAfter the release of the confirmatory segment, post a preprint to PsyArXiv detailing the results of the analyses of the exploratory and confirmatory segments. To be eligible for the award, the preprint must be date-stamped by 12pm UTC, January 31, 2020. For the purposes of winning the award, the preprint may be very brief –tables or figures illustrating the results along with some descriptive text are sufficient. However, if the research team wishes, the preprint may be more detailed. The PsyArXiv preprint should be tagged with the study code for this project: “PSA001”.\n\nBefore issuing the awards, members of the Data and Methods Committee will verify that these steps have been followed. Below are the key dates of this data release plan:\n\nThe simulated dataset, along with a codebook, will be released (posted on OSF, tweeted, Facebooked, and blogged) on August 31, 2019, 24:00 UTC, 8pm EST (so it’s available today!!). It, along with detailed documentation of the dataset, are available at this OSF page.\nThe exploratory segment can be found here, and was posted on October 31, 2019, concurrent with the submission of this project’s Stage 2 Registered Report.\nThe preregistered analyses should be submitted via this form by November 30, 2019, 12pm UTC.\nThe confirmatory segment will be released concurrently with the publication of the Stage 2 paper at Nature Human Behaviour.\nThe preprint should be posted within one month of the release of the confirmatory segment. Once posted, the preprint can be submitted to the PSA001 team via this form.\n\nIf you have questions about this process, or the data that we have available, contact the PSA001 data manager (Patrick S. Forscher) at schnarrd@gmail.com. Conclusion We hope this project can serve as an exemplar of how the details of data release can add value to the scientific knowledge generated from a particular dataset. We hope you consider participating in our Secondary Analysis Challenge so we can see if this is indeed the case."

    "text": "We are releasing our draft vision document for feedback from anyone. You do not need to be a PSA member to comment, and we welcome your input via comments in the google doc or sent via email (psysciaccelerator@gmail.com). Soon after founding the PSA, we collectively established our mission statement, core values, selected our first studies, and drafted initial policies for how we conduct our projects. Then we got to work! We focused on the most pressing needs of planning and conducting our studies and setting up our organizational and governance structures. We now need to also focus on long-term planning to ensure the PSA is a sustainable project that works best for psychological science and its members. The current document represents an early step in our formal planning process in two ways: 1) it will undergo several rounds of feedback from PSA members prior to being voted on as possible PSA policy, and 2) if it is ratified it will form just one portion of a more detailed strategic plan to be drafted in 2020 and then reassessed annually thereafter. Before we can draft a full strategic plan that includes more specific activities, goals, funding strategy, and a projected budget, we need broad community buy-in on the ideas and basic plans outlined in the vision document. To that end, the draft now open for feedback from anyone (PSA member or not) during the entire month of September 2019. The PSA Directors will edit the document in response to this feedback during October, and we will put the revised document up for a vote by the PSA network during November. If the vision statement is not ratified during that vote, we will continue to iteratively solicit feedback, edit, and vote until a version has been ratified. If it is ratified during the November vote, it will be published on the PSA website in December. We will then begin the more detailed strategic planning process. The 5-year strategic plan will follow the same timeline in 2020 as this vision document is following in 2019. The Directors will draft the plan January through August, we will solicit feedback in September, we will edit in October, and all PSA members will vote in November. The process of assessing, revising, seeking feedback, and ultimately voting on the strategic plan will occur annually thereafter following the same month-by-month schedule. Thank you in advance for any feedback you provide!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA), a network of over 500 labs collaborating to collect psychological data from large-scale international samples of people, is currently accepting study proposals from all areas of psychological science. Anyone can submit a proposal, regardless of PSA membership status, research area, methodology, or career stage. We especially encourage submissions in research areas including but not limited to clinical psychology, community psychology, developmental psychology, and neuroscience. The deadline for submission is September 15th, 2019. The mission of the PSA is to accelerate the accumulation of reliable and generalizable evidence in psychological science, reducing the distance between the truth about human behavior and mental processes and our current understanding. For a full overview of the PSA, please see our paper introducing our policies and procedures (https://psyarxiv.com/785qu/). For information on previous successful submissions, please see each study’s status page, with descriptions and links to study materials and preprints (https://psysciacc.org/studies/).\nProposed studies can test novel hypotheses or focus on the replication of previous findings, can be basic or applied in focus, and can be exploratory or confirmatory in nature. Because accepted studies will likely involve considerable use of resources, the study selection process begins with the evaluation of a stage 1 Registered Report style submission. Once submitted, the proposals will be masked and checked for completeness. Then, our Study Selection Committee will conduct an initial evaluation of all proposed studies (see below for more information on the feasibility check portion of this initial evaluation), and vote on their acceptability for further consideration. Studies that pass this check will be fully evaluated by 6-11 peer reviewers, shared with all members of the PSA network to be rated, and either provisionally accepted or rejected by the Study Selection Committee. Studies that are provisionally accepted enter a second stage of preparation and final evaluation before the PSA officially accepts the project, makes a public announcement, and recruits data collection labs. During this second stage of preparation and evaluation, the PSA and proposing authors collectively conduct a needs assessment. The goal is to identify all of the resources the provisionally-accepted project will need in terms of methodology, funding, translation, ethics, data monitor, project monitor, and logistics. This is an in-depth feasibility evaluation that will ensure that the project, if officially accepted, can be carried out to a high standard for rigor. Projects that pass the in-depth feasibility evaluation proceed to the preparation phase. During this phase, the PSA assigns key PSA personnel to the project, including a project monitor, methodologist, data monitor, ethics monitor, and translation monitor in accordance with the needs assessment (these roles can be filled by proposing authors if they have the skills and capacity to do so). This group will then meet with the proposing authors to 1) establish a collaboration agreement, 2) identify who will be the lead communicator with data collection labs, and 3) establish a clear deadline for the proposing authors to convert their PSA proposal into a journal-quality draft of a Stage 1 Registered Report (RR). This journal-quality draft RR represents the final record of the motivation for the study and the methods to be used, including analysis plan. PSA directors will review the RR to make the final decision about whether to officially accept the project and make a public announcement to recruit data collection labs (with a link to the RR). Projects that are officially accepted move to the next stage of preparation, in which proposing authors will revise the RR based on feedback on the draft sent out to data collection labs and obtain ethics approval at their primary institution. Even after official acceptance, PSA studies may go through revisions. For instance, reviewers at journals may suggest additional measures or procedural changes. Accepted proposals are not unchangeable. However, proposing authors and the PSA will make every effort to minimize the likelihood of post-acceptance changes. If the changes necessary after acceptance are too many in number or too significant, the PSA may ask proposing authors to withdraw their project and resubmit it during the next call for studies. Changes that are most likely to trigger a request for resubmission are those that increase the burden on data collecting sites. After official acceptance, all review materials (submissions, peer reviews, network ratings, and Study Selection Committee decision letters) will be made publicly available for accepted submissions, but not rejected submissions."

    "text": "Feasibility\nAll feasibility decisions are made with respect to our current, and ever-changing, resources. Although the PSA is comprised of hundreds of labs from around the world who have agreed, in principle, to volunteer some of their resources to PSA projects, we may not be able to accommodate all types of designs. A few important feasibility considerations that may result in a study not moving beyond the feasibility check include:\n\nDoes the study require specialized equipment (e.g., eye-tracking, EEG) or proprietary experimental software (e.g., E-Prime) to be used at the data collection sites?\nCan experimental materials and analysis scripts be shared easily and made publicly available?\nDoes the study require “hard-to reach” samples (e.g., children, minority groups, clinical populations, etc.)?\nIs the target sample size per site, number of data collection sites, duration of the individual data collection sessions, and number of data collection sessions required fully justified and balanced so as to not overburden the PSA network?\nIs the likelihood and severity of risk to participants kept to a minimum, such that the risk is not greater than what participants would face normally and would not require special consideration or deliberation from an ethics board?"

Submissions normally include a description of the key background literature and motivation for the study, hypotheses, study procedures, proposed statistical analysis plan, a statistical power analysis, and pilot data (wherever applicable).\n\nIntroduction\nA review of the relevant literature that motivates the research question and a full description of the study aims and hypotheses.\n\n\nMethod\nA full description of proposed sample characteristics, including criteria for data inclusion and exclusion (e.g., outlier extraction). Procedures for objectively defining exclusion criteria caused by technical errors or for any other reasons must be specified, including details of how and under what conditions data would be replaced. A description of study procedures in sufficient detail to allow another researcher to repeat the methodology exactly, without requiring further information. Proposed analysis pipeline, including all preprocessing steps, and a precise description of all planned analyses, including appropriate correction for multiple comparisons. Specify all covariates or regressors. Specify analysis decisions that are contingent on the outcome of prior analyses.\n\n\nResults\nStudies involving Neyman-Pearson inference must include a statistical power analysis. Estimated effect sizes should be justified with reference to the existing literature or theory. Because publication bias inflates published estimates of effect size, power analysis should be based on the lowest available or meaningful estimate of the effect size. In the case of highly uncertain effect sizes, a variable sample size and interim data analysis is permissible but with inspection points stated in advance, appropriate Type I error correction for ‘peeking’ employed, and a final stopping rule for data collection outlined. For studies involving analyses with Bayes factors, the predictions of the theory must be specified so that a Bayes factor can be calculated. Authors should indicate what distribution will be used to represent the predictions of the theory and how its parameters will be specified. Full descriptions must be provided of any outcome-neutral criteria that must be met for successful testing of the stated hypotheses. Such quality checks might include the absence of floor or ceiling effects in data distributions, positive controls, or other quality checks that are orthogonal to the experimental hypotheses.\n\n\nSupplemental Materials\nInclude full questionnaires, stimuli, and materials needed to conduct the study. Pilot data can be included to establish proof of concept, effect size estimations, or feasibility of proposed methods. Simulated data and analysis scripts are ideal for clarity of the exclusion criteria and analysis plan.\nThese guidelines were adapted from https://osf.io/pukzy\nSubmissions can be made via this google form. Submissions will be accepted until 23:59 in the last time zone on earth on September 15th, 2019. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to email the PSA Director (Chris Chartier, cchartie@ashland.edu)."

    "text": "DONATE HERE\nIn response to the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic, the Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA) issued a call on March 13th for rapid and impactful proposals to understand the psychological and behavioral aspects of the pandemic. The response to our call has been both enthusiastic and heartwarming -- we received over 60 submissions within the four-day window. The Psychological Science Accelerator is the largest research network of researchers in the social sciences. We now have over 500 labs from over 77 countries. This network includes the top scientists in psychology, with expertise on study design, data analysis, ethics, study management, and translation. Researchers from all over the entire world submit their study proposals to this network. We strongly believe our combined resources can make an impact in this humanitarian crisis.\n\nWe are working quickly to select the very best proposals from the 60+ submissions that we received. Based on our current pool, the topics of our COVID-19 studies could range from behavioral interventions to improve adherence to preventive health measures, to interventions to fight fake news about COVID-19, to methods to reduce the anxiety that accompanies social distancing. We are confident that our COVID-19 initiative will make an impact. However, the initiative would be all the more impactful if we had more financial resources at our disposal. These financial resources would allow us to:\n\nPay for participant compensation at sites without large research budgets\nUse recruitment methods in some sites that do not rely on convenience sampling\nPay for social media advertising to assist with recruitment efforts\nProvide stipends to translators so that our projects can be conducted in non-English languages\nProvide a stipend for a project manager who could ensure the full project happens on a rapid timetable\n\nIn short, financial resources would allow us to have an even greater chance to generate informative research papers and datasets. Because we plan to share these datasets and papers freely and openly, these research products should allow us to substantially improve our knowledge of the behavioral science of COVID-19, thereby contributing to policy discussions about how to mitigate COVID-19’s pernicious public health effects. If you would like to help us in this endeavor, you can contribute to our financial resources via our PayPal. The community response to COVID-19 has been extremely gratifying. Let’s use our collective skills and resources to understand and respond to this evolving crisis."

    "text": "Today, the PSA is launching a pilot of a new stream of activity called “PSA-affiliated projects”.\nDue to resource and infrastructure constraints, the PSA is limited in the number of projects it can officially support. Nonetheless, members of the PSA often self-organize to create initiatives and collaborations that are not “officially” supported by the PSA, but are nonetheless guided by PSA principles and policies. The goal for the PSA-affiliated project line is to develop a formal mechanism for recognizing, promoting, and supporting these types of activities.\nOfficial policies and infrastructure will be developed along the way, but PSA-affiliated projects will be expected to follow three rules:\n1. Be led by at least one member of the PSA who has agreed to abide by the PSA Code of Conduct.\n2. Follow the five PSA Core Principles (or transparently articulate why those principles are not followed).\n3. Provide annual updates on how PSA core principles are being upheld (until the project is completed).\nTo pilot this initiative, we will start with one project: \"The Preference-Matching Project: Testing the Predictive Validity of Ideal Partner Preference-Matching Across Cultures\", led by Paul Eastwick, Jehan Sparks, Eli J. Finkel, & Eva M. Meza. This project provides a unique opportunity to test the PSA-affiliated initiative because it was originally accepted with minor revisions by the PSA Study Selection Committee--but placed on a waitlist due to PSA resource constraints. PSA committees will not offer direct support to this project, but we suspect that many members of the PSA would be interested in contributing.\nSee the following links for a manuscript draft and recruitment flyer.\nIf members of the PSA seem interested in more of these types of initiatives, we will consider expanding this program in the future!"

    "title": "Special Call for Studies - Studying Generalizability with Global Samples",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA), supported by the John Templeton Foundation (JTF), welcomes study proposals to test the generalizability of phenomena related to JTF strategic priorities with large, global samples.\nThe PSA is a distributed network of researchers from the behavioral sciences across the globe. Our more than 1300 collaborators represent 84 countries from all six populated continents. The mission of the PSA is to accelerate the accumulation of reliable and generalizable evidence in psychological science. This call for studies will select projects that fit within the 5 topic areas, broadly construed, that are prioritized by the JTF.\n\nJTF Priority Topics\nTo be eligible for this call, projects must investigate questions related to one or more of the strategic priorities of JTF. Below is a list of those priorities. Each is followed by some example research questions and topics. These are meant to just be examples; they are not an exhaustive list of the research questions that could be encompassed by each priority.\n\nThe dynamics of religious change. Why do religions flourish or lose adherents? What kinds of features of religious organizations drive or repel members? Why and how do people switch religious identities?\nIntellectual humility. Which factors enhance or inhibit intellectual humility? How can we better study the concept of intellectual humility?\nReligious cognition. What is the nature of religious belief and how can it be better measured? What causes religious or spiritual experiences and what are the effects of those experiences? How do individuals develop and revise their religious beliefs?\nThe science of character virtue. In particular, what helps individuals to develop curiosity and love? What are the consequences of those virtues? How do religions and perceptions of supernatural agents affect virtue and morality development?\nHealth, religion, and spirituality. Are there associations between religious/spiritual beliefs, experiences, practices, and identities, and physical and mental health? If so, are there underlying causal mechanisms?\n\n\n\nProposal Selection\nPSA projects are selected using a rigorous review process. Researchers submit detailed proposals to the PSA for consideration. These proposals resemble 5,000 words Stage 1 Registered Reports (e.g., Chambers, 2013), and contain a theoretical introduction, a description of the planned sample and methods, as well as hypotheses and an analysis plan to test those hypotheses. \nThe proposals then undergo several rounds of review, overseen by the PSA’s Study Selection Committee (SSC). First, each proposal is screened for feasibility given the PSA’s current capacity and resources. For instance, a proposal that requires dozens of collection sites with fMRI machines is likely to be rejected based on infeasibility. Simultaneously, the SSC screens out submissions deemed low quality. Proposals that pass this screening are then sent out for peer review. Each proposal is reviewed by 5-10 reviewers, consisting of both PSA members and external experts (see Supporting Materials for peer review rating criteria). These reviewers are selected based on their methodological and/or theoretical expertise related to a given proposal. All submissions are also rated quantitatively by the entire PSA network. The (SSC) then aggregates two sources of info, the comments of the reviewers and ratings from the network, before selecting projects for the PSA to pursue.\n\n\nFunding and Personnel Support for Studies Resulting from this Call\nProjects selected through this special call will be advertised to members of the  PSA network in collaboration with the proposing authors. Each study will be supported by $40,000 of direct funding for data collection. The proposing author teams will also be collectively supported by 3 full-time scientific staff members (a Research Coordinator, a Postdoctoral Researcher, and a Research Scientist), an additional ⅓ time senior staff member (Dr. Christopher R. Chartier), a ½ time staff member equivalent team of undergraduate research assistants, several members of PSA committees (at their discretion), and members of the network at large (at their discretion).\n\n\nSubmission Requirements\nThe following components are required for all submissions:\n\nCover Page, including the title of the study, date of the latest draft, and keywords\nAbstract of up to 150 words\nMain body submission text of up to 5,000 words\nA version of the submission with a cover page included\nA masked version of the submission without the cover page\nReferences\nSupplementary materials\n\nThe following guidelines are intended to assist you in the preparation of your study submission to the PSA. Submissions normally include a description of the key background literature and motivation for the study, hypotheses, study procedures, proposed statistical analysis plan, a statistical power analysis, and pilot data (wherever applicable).\n\n\nIntroduction\nA review of the relevant literature that motivates the research question and a full description of the study aims and hypotheses.\n\n\nMethod\nA full description of proposed sample characteristics, including criteria for data inclusion and exclusion (e.g., outlier extraction). Procedures for objectively defining exclusion criteria caused by technical errors or for any other reasons must be specified, including details of how and under what conditions data would be replaced.\nA description of study procedures in sufficient detail to allow another researcher to repeat the methodology exactly, without requiring further information.\n\n\nAnalysis Plan\nProposed analysis pipeline, including all preprocessing steps, and a precise description of all planned analyses, including appropriate correction for multiple comparisons. Specify all covariates or regressors. Specify analysis decisions that are contingent on the outcome of prior analyses.\nStudies involving Neyman-Pearson inference must include a statistical power analysis. Estimated effect sizes should be justified with reference to the existing literature or theory. Because publication bias inflates published estimates of effect size, power analysis should be based on the lowest available or meaningful estimate of the effect size.\nIn the case of highly uncertain effect sizes, variable sample size and interim data analysis is permissible but with inspection points stated in advance, appropriate Type I error correction for ‘peeking’ employed, and a final stopping rule for data collection outlined.\nFor studies involving analyses with Bayes factors, the predictions of the theory must be specified so that a Bayes factor can be calculated. Authors should indicate what distribution will be used to represent the predictions of the theory and how its parameters will be specified.\nFull descriptions must be provided of any outcome-neutral criteria that must be met for successful testing of the stated hypotheses. Such quality checks might include the absence of floor or ceiling effects in data distributions, positive controls, or other quality checks that are orthogonal to the experimental hypotheses.\n\n\nSupplemental Materials\nInclude full questionnaires, stimuli, and materials needed to conduct the study. Pilot data can be included to establish proof of concept, effect size estimations, or feasibility of proposed methods. Simulated data and analysis scripts are recommended to provide clarity about the exclusion criteria and analysis plan.\nThese guidelines were adapted from https://osf.io/pukzy.\n\n\nEvaluation Criteria\nTwo studies will be selected and implemented through this year’s call. The project will also include a second round of submissions, with two additional studies to be selected, in 2023.\nIn your submission, you should clearly state how your project aligns with the goals of this special call and discuss why your research topic would specifically benefit from global data collection (e.g., theoretical reasons to predict global variation). \nIn evaluating submissions for this special call for studies, we will prioritize projects whose designs are most well suited for promoting generalizability. In particular, we will prioritize studies that seek global samples (as opposed to studies that wish to sample from one or a few countries), studies with very high statistical power, and studies that are more strongly grounded in previous research (such as replication and generalization studies). All of these criteria are intended to maximize our chances of producing generalizable insights on phenomena-of-interest.\nIn addition, we will evaluate proposals for this special call together so that we can ensure variation across the projects. In particular, we will strive to select a package of studies that, collectively, represent a range of JTF priorities, study designs (e.g., experimental vs. correlational), and researcher backgrounds (e.g., research specialty, researcher location, etc.). This way, we will avoid overrepresenting a given topic, type of research, or type of researcher in this initiative. \n\n\nSelection Process and Timeline\nSubmission deadline: July 20, 2022.\nInitial feasibility and quality review: July 20- July 27, 2022.\nReviewer selection: July 27-August 3, 2022.\nNetwork rating solicitation: August 3, 2022.\nReview submission deadline: August 17, 2022.\nNetwork rating deadline: August 17, 2022\nStudy selection decision deadline: August 31, 2022.\nPossible submission outcomes include “desk rejection” upon initial review, rejection upon full review, provisional acceptance, or an invitation to revise and resubmit for next year’s call.\nFollowing a successful period of needs assessment, preparation, personnel identification, lab recruitment, and pre-registration, provisionally selected studies will commence data collection in early 2023 and end data collection in late 2023.\nPlease use this form to submit your proposal.\nFor pre-submission inquiries, please email Chris Chartier at cchartie@ashland.edu. He is happy to meet with proposing authors and/or answer questions about what is likely to make for a strong submission."

    "text": "The world is currently witnessing a public health crisis that is unprecedented in our lifetimes: the global COVID-19 pandemic. At the Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA), we are deeply concerned about the many impacts of this outbreak, but we are also optimistic about behavioral science’s potential to mitigate these impacts. With our network of more than 500 labs from over 70 countries, we believe that – with your help – the PSA can play a crucial role in this process. This can only occur if our member labs, and new labs who would like to join us, contribute to project administration and local data collection. Last week, we put out a call for rapid and impactful studies to understand the behavioral and psychological aspects of the COVID-19 outbreak. We received an overwhelming response. The community submitted a whopping 66 (!!) proposals. 141 PSA members voted on the 11 proposals that passed triage. Yesterday, we provisionally accepted the three proposals that received the most votes, with another four proposals on our “waitlist.” Waitlisted studies will come off the waitlist if we receive an overwhelming response during lab recruitment and if early preparation for our first three studies goes smoothly. We anticipate that all PSA COVID-Rapid studies will be bundled into a single data collection effort. You can read more details about the selected studies and the process of contributing to data collection here. We need your help. This project is big. We aim to recruit thousands of participants from all over the globe. We can only succeed with this aim through the collective energy of our members. You can contribute your time and expertise. One way to help is by joining the COVID-Rapid project. After joining, you can volunteer to manage the projects, translate the project materials into one of over 50 languages, or help with data collection by recruiting online participants from your local community. If you have questions about the process of joining the study, contact the PSA COVID-19 Gmail account at psacovid@gmail.com. To join this project:\n\nBecome a member of the PSA by registering at the member website\nLog in to the member website\nClick on My Lab &gt; Study Sign Up\nComplete your member profile at My Account &gt; Create Profile\n\nIf you wish to recruit participants for the project, you must be willing to do so fast. This will require very fast ethics approval and data collection. We anticipate that most sites will either join an existing IRB application as an investigator (e.g., the application at Chris Chartier’s Ashland University), ask their local IRBs to defer to an IRB that has granted us approval, obtain an ethics waiver because the study is minimal risk, or go through expedited review. We will work with you on the ethics process once you join the project. You can also contribute financially. To pull off a project of this magnitude, we also need financial contributions. For those who can, you can donate via PayPal. Every dollar received will be spent supporting this project. Financial contributions will be used to pay participants, aid with recruitment, compensate translators, and compensate other administrative contributors. The PSA has an opportunity to activate our global network to confront the global challenge of COVID-19. We will only succeed with your support and involvement. Together, we can harness the potential of behavioral science to further the public good."

    "title": "How many resources does the PSA possess?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Patrick S. Forscher, Bastien Paris, and Hans IJzerman\nHow many resources does the PSA possess? This is a question that affects many activities within the PSA -- prime among them the annual decision of how many studies the PSA is able to accept. Here are a few other examples:\n\nPeople involved in the selection of studies must decide whether the PSA can feasibly support studies with special requirements, such as a proposal to conduct a multi-site EEG project or a project involving a low-prevalence (and therefore difficult to recruit) population. \nPeople involved in writing PSA-focused grants must be able to accurately describe the size and scale of the network to make their grant arguments and planning concrete. \nPeople involved in managing the PSA’s finances need to know the people and projects that have the highest financial need. \nPeople involved in regional recruitment need to know how many members are currently located in a specific world region and the number of participants those members can muster for a typical PSA study. \n\nIn its first three years, we have had to rely on ad hoc sources to answer questions about PSA resources. Today, with the release of the PSA’s first study capacity report, we now have a source that is more systematic. This blog describes the logic that underlies the report, gives some of its top-level findings, and outlines what we plan to do with the report now that we have it.\nHow to think about and report on PSA resources\nThe PSA’s most basic activity is running multi-site studies, and one of the most fundamental resource-dependent decisions PSA leadership must make is how many proposals for these multi-site studies the PSA will accept. Thus, a single multi-site study provides a useful yardstick for measuring and thinking about PSA resources.\nThe PSA’s newly-ratified resource capacity policy takes just such an approach. It considers PSA resources from the perspective of helping PSA leadership decide how many studies they should accept in a given year. From this perspective, the most basic unit of analysis is the study submission slot, a promise by the PSA to take on a new multi-site study. Study submission slots are limited by at least two types of resources:\n\nData collection capacity. This is the PSA’s ability to recruit participants for multi-site studies. Data collection capacity is mainly governed by the number of PSA members located in psychology labs throughout the world. However, money can also expand the PSA’s data collection capacity; the PSA has occasionally contracted with panel-provider firms to recruit participants on its behalf.\nAdministrative capacity. This is the PSA’s ability to perform the administrative tasks required to support multi-site studies. Administrative capacity is mainly governed by the availability of labor, whether that labor be paid or volunteer.\n\nThe resource capacity policy also allows for the possibility of study slots that add on special requirements or evaluation criteria. These special submission slots might require, for example, that any studies submitted for consideration to that slot involve EEG equipment. Alternatively, the slots might require that the submitted studies involve investigating the psychological aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic. We will go into more detail about how we think about these special submission slots in a later post. For the time being, we simply note that assessing our resource capacity will allow us to understand the sorts of special submission slots we can accommodate.\nThe PSA’s data collection and administrative capacities are both in flux. The PSA’s ability to accommodate more specialized types of studies also fluctuates on a yearly basis. Moreover, the PSA is committed to the cultural and national diversity of psychology research -- activities that are dependent on its reach in under-resourced countries. Accurate assessment of all these capacities therefore requires ongoing documentation of its members, member characteristics (including country of origin), and its yearly activities. Currently, our documentation happens in a shared Google Drive, Slack, the PSA’s OSF project and the subprojects for each of its studies, and the recently-created PSA member website.\nAccording to policy, these various sources of documentation are consulted in a comprehensive way to form a complete picture of the PSA’s resources. This consultation results in an annual  study capacity report, which can inform decisions and activities involving the PSA’s resources.\nFindings from the first study capacity report\nThe first PSA study capacity report is large and comprehensive. Here are some big-picture findings:\n\nThe PSA currently has 1,400+ members from 71 countries.\nOut of seven studies, six are still underway collecting data.\nBased on our past data collection capacity, we have the ability to recruit a minimum of 20,000 participants over the upcoming scholarly year for new PSA projects.\nTwo out of three PSA members come from North America (24%) and Western Europe (41%). \nWe do not have sufficient information to accurately estimate the number of administrative hours available for each PSA role.\n\nHowever, these big-picture findings hide a lot of important detail that may be important for PSA decision-making. For example, here are a few additional tidbits that come out of the report:\n\nThe number of PSA member registrations almost tripled as a result of the COVID-Rapid project.\nAt the time of the report’s writing, and excluding PSA007, the PSA will need to recruit 30,000 participants to complete its active roster of projects.\nAbout 20% of the PSA’s membership have a social psychology focus area.\nAbout 90% of people in active PSA administrative roles are located in North America (63%) and Western Europe (21%).\n\nIf you’re interested in digging into more of these details, you can find the full report here.\nWhat’s next?\nAs outlined by policy, the main purpose of the report is to inform decisions about how many studies the PSA can accept in the next wave of study submissions. Thus, an important next step for this report is for the upper-level leadership to use the report to come to a decision about study submission slots.\nHowever, the study capacity report has already catalyzed a number of ongoing conversations about what the PSA is, what it should be in the future, and how the PSA should go about meeting its aspirations for itself. Some of these conversations have resulted in their own dedicated blog posts, which will be posted to the PSA blog in the next few days.\nIn the meantime, we welcome your thoughts about the PSA’s study capacity and issues related to it. We believe that compiling this report has been a useful exercise precisely because the process of compiling the report has inspired so many useful conversations about the PSA’s direction and goals. This reinforces our commitment to maintaining this useful reporting structure in future years.\n---\nFunding Note: The study capacity report was made possible via the work of Bastien Paris; his internship at Université Grenoble Alpes is funded by a grant provided by the Psychological Science Accelerator. Patrick S. Forscher is paid via a French National Research Agency “Investissements d’avenir” program grant (ANR-15-IDEX-02) awarded to Hans IJzerman."

Eventually, we hope the site can become a \"one stop shop\" for each PSA member to find information about the status and next steps for any PSA studies they have joined, and any PSA tasks that need new contributors.

This process is meant to ensure that all necessary components (sample size justification, analysis scripts, etc.) are present in the analysis plan when it is submitted for external review. Furthermore, the approval process should provide some minimum reassurance that major methodological issues and flaws in the analysis plan have been addressed before launch of data collection, in the very rare cases that such flaws escape the awareness of the co-author team. In line with the proposed guidelines for PSA policy proposals, the DM committee have sought and incorporated feedback from the PSA director and associate directors. We now invite all members of the PSA to provide feedback on the document, which can be found here. The document will be open for feedback for one week as of the posting of this newsletter. After this period the DM committee will incorporate feedback, and subsequently submit the policy for approval by vote by PSA Directors and all members of the PSA."

    "text": "Proposal Selection\nAll full proposals, regardless of whether they were a part of study incubation, will have the same requirements and will be given equal consideration during the project selection process.\nPSA projects are selected using a rigorous review process. Researchers submit detailed proposals for consideration. These proposals resemble Stage 1 Registered Reports (e.g., Chambers, 2013), and contain a theoretical introduction and hypothesis, a description of the planned sample and methods, and an analysis plan to test those hypotheses (see below section for requirements).\nThe proposals then undergo several rounds of review, overseen by the PSA’s Study Selection Committee (SSC). First, each proposal is screened for feasibility given the PSA’s current capacity and resources (Initial feasibility and quality review). For instance, a proposal that requires dozens of collection sites with fMRI machines is likely to be rejected based on infeasibility. Simultaneously, the SSC screens out submissions deemed low quality. Proposals that pass this screening are then sent out for peer review (Reviewer identification & review submission). Each proposal is reviewed by 5-10 reviewers, consisting of both PSA members and external experts. These reviewers are identified based on their ethical, methodological, and/or theoretical expertise related to a given proposal. All submissions are also rated quantitatively by members of the PSA network (Network rating). The SSC then synthesizes the reviewer and network feedback to select projects for the PSA to pursue (Study selection decision). See Evaluation Criteria section for more details and anticipated timeline."

Specify all covariates or regressors. Specify analysis decisions that are contingent on the outcome of prior analyses.\nStudies involving frequentist inference must include a statistical power analysis. Estimated effect sizes should be justified with reference to the existing literature or theory. Because publication bias inflates published estimates of effect size, power analysis should be based on the lowest available or meaningful estimate of the effect size.\nIn the case of highly uncertain effect sizes, variable sample size and interim data analysis is permissible but with inspection points stated in advance, appropriate Type I error correction for ‘peeking’ employed, and a final stopping rule for data collection outlined.\nFor studies involving analyses with Bayes factors, the predictions of the theory must be specified so that a Bayes factor can be calculated. Authors should indicate what distribution will be used to represent the predictions of the theory and how its parameters will be specified.\nFull descriptions must be provided of any outcome-neutral criteria that must be met for successful testing of the stated hypotheses. Such quality checks might include the absence of floor or ceiling effects in data distributions, positive controls, or other quality checks that are orthogonal to the experimental hypotheses."

    "text": "PSA member Biljana Gjoneska has recently become an Editorial Board member for the following journals: Journal of Behavioural Addictions, BMC Psychology, PloS ONE, and Discover Psychology. Here’s her message:\nHence, I would like to use the opportunity and extend invitation to all PSA members to consider these journals as potential venues to: a) Submit a paper (in a role of an author) b) Evaluate a paper (become a reviewer) In both cases, the scope of the journal should be aligned with the research interests of the interested candidates. For the latter case, there are some tangible benefits to becoming a reviewer (aside from the opportunity to be updated on the latest research and to sharpen the critical thought), including: public recognition of reviewing services via the reviewer hub (on Web of Science) or/and sometimes via the journal (in annually published lists), possible discounts for publishing in the journal, possible invitations to become a member of the Editorial Board etc.\nTherefore, I would be very grateful if you could publish my Call for Reviewers for the appointed journals along with the update regarding my academic advancement, and invite all interested candidates to express interest by compiling the following form: https://forms.gle/UE9MGmQkEbAjFbbH8 Looking forward to the prospects for extended collaboration with as many PSA members as possible.\nWarmly, Biljana Gjoneska"
