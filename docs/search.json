    "text": "Random assignment to experimentally created and otherwise meaningless social groups is sufficient to create ingroup preference. This striking phenomenon, now referred to as the minimal group effect (MGE), has theoretical importance for explaining in-group biases and practical implications for anti-bias interventions. However, due to small and culturally restricted samples, as well as insufficient attention to moderators, the extent to which the MGE is a somewhat specialized or restricted phenomenon, or whether it can be considered a general human universal that underlies culturally salient forms of real-world bias, remains unknown. We aim to recruit a large sample of participants across cultures through the Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA)’s vast network to test the cultural prevalence of the MGE and to compare it to two forms of real-group bias (bias in favor of family members and bias in favor of national ingroups). We will examine the underlying mechanisms of the ingroup bias by testing the relationship between these forms of bias and a number of theoretically important individual- and cultural-level moderators."

    "section": "",
    "text": "When asked to imagine a person, people tend to think of a man (Hamilton, 1991). The same is true for some social groups as well–when asked to imagine a Black or White person, people tend to imagine a Black or White man (Schug, Alt, & Klauer, 2015). One reason for this is androcentrism: the belief that men are the default and women the exception or “other” (Bailey, LaFrance, & Dovidio, 2018; Bem, 1993; Smith & Zarate, 1992).The present research will use a global distributed laboratory network to describe the gendered nature of prejudice against seven social categories (i.e., Black people, East Asian people, White people, police, politicians, and criminals). We hypothesize that if a prejudice occurs for the group it is more strongly related to prejudice of the men of that social category. This study will be across several laboratories and languages as it is paired with PSA 002 for data collection."
