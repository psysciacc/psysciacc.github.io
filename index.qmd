The Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA) is a globally distributed network of researchers that pool intellectual and material resources to accelerate the accumulation of rigorous knowledge in psychological science. We believe that many of the world's biggest challenges cannot be addressed by a single researcher or small team. We thus seek to leverage team science to address big questions rooted in theory and/or real-world problems. For example, of the 12+ projects in our [study portfolio](projects.html), we have:

-   Tested whether COVID-19-related cognitive framing manipulations impact emotions, behaviors, attitudes, and well-being around the world.
-   Examined cultural and situations forces that shape moral dilemma judgments.
-   Examined the extent to which stereotype threat impacts academic performance among African American college students.
- And other cognitive and social psychology phenomena. Check our out projects [here](projects.html).
