The Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA) is a globally distributed network of researchers (??? 2468 researchers from 73 countries) that pool intellectual and material resources to accelerate the accumulation of rigorous knowledge in psychological science.

We believe that many of the world's biggest challenges cannot be addressed by a single researcher or small team. We thus seek to leverage [big team science](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00150-2) to address big questions rooted in theory and/or real-world problems. For example, of the 12+ projects in our study portfolio (link to study tab), we have:

-   Tested whether COVID-19-related cognitive framing manipulations impact emotions, behaviors, attitudes, and well-being around the world.

-   Examined cultural and situations forces that shape moral dilemma judgments.

-   Examined the extent to which stereotype threat impacts academic performance among African American college students [ongoing].
