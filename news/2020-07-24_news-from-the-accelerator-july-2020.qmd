July has been extremely active in the PSA, and this newsletter contains
updates on many projects, but we'd like to highlight two things up
front:

First, the PSA has taken a very big and important step as an
organization this month by initiating our first truly democratic
election for an open Associate Director position! You can read the
candidates' statements at the links below to prepare for the vote.

Second, we are continuing data collection on the PSA-Covid-Rapid studies
as long as we can afford to, which is likely through the end of August.
The team could use some more data collection help to make sure we clear
our pre-registered N targets! Email psacovid@gmail.com if you are
interested in joining or have questions about joining.

**Election**

The two candidates in our election for an open Associate Director
position, Peter Mallik and John Protzko, have provided written
statements describing why they\'ve chosen to run, and describing what
they\'d like to achieve in the Associate Director role if elected. 

You can read each statement by clicking the candidate\'s name here:
[Mallik](https://osf.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f8bacf294e5a46e350b638374&id=b3ade8bed0&e=2a954b69c4)
and
[Protzko](https://osf.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f8bacf294e5a46e350b638374&id=6e158964fc&e=2a954b69c4).
Additionally, we have posted each statement in dedicated slack channels.
I encourage all members to read them, consider them carefully, and ask
any questions you have for the candidates! You can ask questions by
joining the PSA slack workspace at [this
link](https://osf.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f8bacf294e5a46e350b638374&id=43dbddd38d&e=2a954b69c4),
and then joining the #associatedirectorelection_protzko and
#associatedirectorelection_mallik channels. The slack discussion closes
today, but you can read the questions and answers throughout the
election. Soon, we will email each PSA member with instructions about
how to vote.

**Conference**

Approximately ⅔ of the available seats are full, so make sure to
[register
now](https://osf.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f8bacf294e5a46e350b638374&id=77613ed75a&e=fad273e495)
to claim your spot if you'd like to attend. We have a recent surge of
attendees requesting free admission, and would very much like to to be
able to fill all requests, so we would be very grateful if a few
additional members were able and willing to pay the \$60 admission fee
to open up more free spots. Also, the program is  slowly but surely
filling up. If you have work or ideas you would like to present at the
conference be sure to fill out of new [submission
form](https://osf.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f8bacf294e5a46e350b638374&id=2ba832a3cc&e=fad273e495)!
We've started a [general info
page](https://osf.us18.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f8bacf294e5a46e350b638374&id=0517f472ef&e=fad273e495)
that highlights a few presentations already set and links out to the
current draft program. We hope to have the full program set in late
August and will share an update with the full network when it is ready
to go!

**Current Studies**

-   **PSA 001-** The Stage 2 Registered Report has been resubmitted to
    Nature Human Behaviour. Now we are waiting for the final decision
    from the editor.
-   **PSA 002/003-** The 002 and 003 teams are in the final stages of
    moving our experiments from Open Sesame/Qualtrics to Lab.JS. Thanks
    to the hard work of Merle Schuckart, we have drafts of the new
    programs and are in the process of ensuring that the web versions of
    the studies retain fidelity to the original protocols and
    troubleshooting the studies. The new version of the experiment
    should fully integrate both the 002 and 003 procedures into one
    online protocol, greatly simplifying future data collection.
-   **PSA 004-** Data collection has slowed down as many members'
    universities have concluded their semesters. We do however need more
    CREP reviewers as we wrap up this project at the end of the year.
    CREP reviewers look over each lab's OSF page to ensure that each lab
    is performing the study as planned. If you or someone else is
    interested please have them fill out this
    [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdB7BDtPSI6q_7UxeUcqy4EKNxtYazZwR7P9SVbVKmd6rFBlg/viewform).
-   **PSA 005-** 005 is waiting on a decision on our Stage 1 submission
    at Nature Human Behaviour.
-   **PSA 006-** 006 is continuing data collection and is slated to
    finish sometime between October and December. We continue to have
    new labs join and are extremely excited to finish up this year!
-   **PSACR 001/002/003-** The PSACR bundle is still collecting data. We
    now have over 19,000 participants (i.e., people who have completed
    the general questions about the pandemic and participated in one or
    more of the study surveys). The survey is offered in 38 (!!)
    languages and dialects, with a handful more to be implemented very
    soon. We are still planning to collect data as long as we can afford
    to, which we expect to be through August. We are also welcoming new
    labs to join data collection if they use one of the languages we\'ve
    translated already (see here for a list of implemented and
    soon-to-be implemented languages
    [http://formr.psysciacc.org/shiny/shiny_app/](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fformr.psysciacc.org%2Fshiny%2Fshiny_app%2F))
    . Email psacovid@gmail.com if you are interested in joining or have
    questions about joining.

**A Chapter on the PSA, QRPS, and Clinical Psych**

A group of PSA members, led by Julie Beshears, are beginning work on an
invited chapter about the PSA and how the PSA\'s design can affect the
presence of questionable research practices (QRPs) in clinical
psychology research.  Ideally, they are seeking individuals with
clinical experience, but other contributions are welcome.  If this
project interests you, you may join the slack channel
(proj_clinical_chapter) or email Julie at <jebeshears@eagles.usi.edu>.

**Committee Updates**

-   **Ethics committee-** We would like to congratulate our newest
    Assistant Director of the ethics committee!! Mike Mensink was just
    appointed the position last week and seems very eager to start in
    his new position. Welcome Mike and we look forward to collaborating
    with you soon!

-   **Translation and Cultural Diversity Committee-** The Translation
    and Cultural Diversity Committee (TCDC) would like to collect data
    on the translation capacity of the PSA for future projects: in which
    countries and for which languages do we have adequate potential
    translators? This knowledge will help us to determine our potential
    capacity, or lack-there-of, in many possible data collection
    languages, and thus make better plans for future projects. Please
    answer this very short, [1-minute
    survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfkWhCPl_Zj1o4EhW3jdwGRLo0Wd9h4aMOW9wXk9wt9CLpYiw/viewform){rel="noreferrer noopener"
    target="_blank"}, to help us. Thank you!!

-   **Project monitoring Committee-** The member website is receiving an
    update soon. A big shout out to the fantastic Erin Buchanan for
    helping the team find a way to manage projects through Canvas. Erin
    will be going over this update and much more at the conference in
    September, so make sure you check that out for more information!

**Recorded for the Chinese Open Science Network Available Online **

Chris Chartier recently gave a talk to the Chinese Open Science Network.
They recorded the presentations and have [posted it
here](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1nZ4y1W7Ee?p=4), so anyone can
watch and reach out with any questions or feedback
(<cchartie@ashland.edu>). 

*Thank you for all that you have, and continue to do, on behalf of the
PSA. Onward!*

***Savannah and Chris***
