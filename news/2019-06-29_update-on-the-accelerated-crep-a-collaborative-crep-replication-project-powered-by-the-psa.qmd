## Post authored by Braeden Hall

Last year, the Collaborative Replications and Education Project
([CREP](https://osf.io/wfc6u/); pronounced like grape) and the
Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA) partnered on a project, now
referred to as the [Accelerated CREP](https://osf.io/n5b3w/) (or PSA 004
Justified True Belief). The mission of the Accelerator is to accelerate
the accumulation of reliable and generalizable evidence in psychological
science, while the mission of the CREP is to improve undergraduate
training through crowdsourced replication. Over the course of the last
year, the CREP and PSA networks have worked together to collaboratively
fulfill these two parallel missions by putting together a [registered
replication report
(RRR)](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/replication),
now provisionally accepted at Advances in Methods and Practices in
Psychological Science (AMPPS; preprint here:
[psyarxiv.com/zeux9](http://psyarxiv.com/zeux9)). The purpose of the
Accelerated CREP is to harness the power of undergraduate research
projects across five continents to address the need for replication in
the field of Psychological Science. Having students perform replications
as part of their psychological science education serves both as a
pedagogical tool for teaching junior researchers about open science and
as a rigorous scientific method for collecting high quality, transparent
data for a field in need of corroboration. When we first began this
project, we didn\'t know whether we would simply preregister the study
or attempt to publish it as a registered report. However, after writing
a short proposal to AMPPS for the project, we were invited in June of
2018 to submit our study plan as a full [Stage 1 registered replication
report
(RRR)](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/replication).
After several months of writing, planning, and R coding multilevel data
simulations and power analyses, we submitted our collaborative study
plan in November 2018. In January 2019, AMPPS requested that we resubmit
our paper with revisions that considerably improved the study plan.
After making these revisions and other improvements, our team
resubmitted the paper back to AMPPS for review in February 2019. In
April 2019, AMPPS requested a few additional changes, which were
resubmitted the following month. And in June 2019, the Accelerated CREP
Stage 1 RRR was provisionally accepted at AMPPS. A lot of changes have
been made to the Accelerated CREP project over the last year since its
inception, and many of those changes arose from our decision to publish
our plan as a registered report. We originally planned a very simple
direct replication, but the AMPPS editor and reviewers made suggestions
for how we could improve our design, including testing similar stimuli
as a random factor to improve our test\'s generalizability, adjusting
our cross-cultural and covariate analysis plans, and improving our
theoretical precision. One of the original authors also suggested that
we transition from using a binary response to a scaled response for a
more sensitive measure of people\'s attributions of knowledge. When
making all of these changes, it was also important for us to always
consider student feasibility against other goals of the study. And,
while publishing a registered report considerably delayed our original
study timeline, it has no doubt resulted in a much more rigorous, much
more fine tuned study from which students can learn. Due to the delays
in our study timeline, we decided to allow some sites who had written
their curriculum around the replicated Turri, Buckwalter, and Blouw
(2015) study to participate in a traditional CREP preregistered direct
replication with their students - which can all be found forked off the
[Accelerated CREP\'s OSF page](https://osf.io/n5b3w/). The data from
these direct replication studies will not be used for our primary
planned multilevel analyses, but they may serve as an interesting
comparison to the rest of the study. The first phase of this joint study
took a lot of collaboration and planning, so we\'re eager to begin data
collection! See below for more information about how to participate,
using SoSciSurvey (and alternatives), CREP procedures, translation
procedures, and some open science teaching resources. **Survey is Now
Live on SoSciSurvey** As of July 27th, the universal English version of
our main online survey is now live! We will have it open for one week
for testing/debugging across all 50+ labs before resetting the data for
sites to begin collecting data from participants. Our survey monitor,
[Sophia
Weissgerber](https://www.uni-kassel.de/fb01/de/institute/psychologie/allgemeine-psychologie/sophia-christin-weissgerber-msc/publikationen.html),
has worked hard to code a universal survey in SoSciSurvey which is now
open for contributors to start testing so they can request site specific
versions, if they need one. Teams not testing in English will use the
PSA procedures to translate the study materials to their local language
(all posted to the OSF), and then Sophia will create a language specific
version for the study with the help of our translation coordinator, [Jan
Philipp RÃ¶er](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jan_Roeer/amp). By
using SoSciSurvey, we are able to provide a boilerplate study experience
to all interested labs that is both free and accessible globally (via
internet access). We will also work with labs to create specific
versions of the survey for those who have more unique needs or who want
to run an extension of the study. We will allow sites to use other
survey programs/applications; however, all data must conform to our
universal data template - which our data monitor, [Daniel
Dunleavy](https://csw.fsu.edu/person/daniel-dunleavy), will share to the
[OSF](http://osf.io/n5b3w/) after contributors have finish testing the
current version. Each lab's data collection plan must be cleared by the
CREP review team prior to collecting data. **Steps to Participate** If
you and/or your students are interested in participating in our
collaborative, student-led project, you will need to take the following
steps (this is an abbreviated list, see the [CREP
step-by-step](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wtv514fz-_xDgH7UdOQcxUWvB8RtdKU1SCm2G04YMEs/edit?usp=sharing)
for more detailed information):

-   **Step 1**: Become a member of the PSA
    -   The PSA is comprised of 760 researchers representing 548
        laboratories from 72 countries across 6 continents ([see map
        here](https://nicholas-coles.shinyapps.io/PSA_Map_Prototype/)).
    -   You can join easily by providing your contact info
        [here](https://psysciacc.org/get-involved/).
-   **Step 2**: Sign up for the [Accelerated
    CREP](https://osf.io/n5b3w/)
    -   First, [provide us with your
        information](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdUif1jYxmf_Mr6svuPm3oqBC7vm3EjbiBdewiqNgzU-Iz7ng/viewform).
        -   If your site will have more than one team of researchers
            collecting data concurrently, you should submit just one OSF
            page for review. We ask that you describe the multiple teams
            in your OSF page wiki, and clearly identify the materials,
            methods, data, and results from each team in your files.
    -   Then, someone from the CREP will contact you with more
        instructions and a project number within two business days.
        -   We will be tracking some details related to each site\'s
            project
            [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bmdr6U0Ut5nBpgYbKiEqTfMT_PXmVXq-em4RvZx-5ZY/edit?usp=sharing).
    -   In the meantime, please feel free to start working on the [CREP
        step-by-step instructions provided
        here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wtv514fz-_xDgH7UdOQcxUWvB8RtdKU1SCm2G04YMEs/edit?usp=sharing).
-   **Step 3**: Get Ethics/IRB Approval
    -   Once you are familiar with the [CREP
        procedures](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wtv514fz-_xDgH7UdOQcxUWvB8RtdKU1SCm2G04YMEs/edit?usp=sharing)
        and you have been assigned a project number, your next step is
        to get ethics approval from your institution.
        -   To help contributors expedite their IRB/Ethics application
            process, we have provided a template for you to use to fill
            out your own institution's ethics application - which can be
            found
            [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xNKG1a8dhzxFph7HH1JhRUCTg32aUY4RrtHLfB-MyIw/edit?usp=sharing).
-   **Step 4**: Submitting Protocol for Review
    -   After you have received your institutional ethics approval, you
        and/or your students will submit your lab's protocol for review
        to the CREP review team.
        -   To submit your protocol for review, you will fork your study
            off the [Accelerated CREP parent OSF
            page](https://osf.io/n5b3w/) to create your lab's
            preregistration on the Open Science Framework (OSF).
            -   Your lab's preregistration will include a written
                protocol that should match all protocols and procedures
                set forth in the Stage 1 RRR.
            -   A video of the methods used for the study.
            -   Your institutional ethics approval.
        -   The CREP review team will work with your group to approve
            your protocol. The goal is approval, no contributors will be
            denied outright. The review process is just to ensure that
            your lab understands the study plan entirely.
-   **Step 5**: Collect Data
    -   After the CREP review team has approved your protocol, you will
        be cleared to collect data.
    -   Overall data collection will end on June 1st, 2020.
        -   Labs who turn in their data report after this date may not
            have their data represented in the Stage 2 paper.
-   **Step 6**: Submit Data
    -   After data collection ends or your team reaches its target
        sample size, your team may submit your data, analysis report,
        and other information to the CREP for a final review.
    -   Once approved, we will collate your data into the aggregate
        dataset for analysis.
        -   Teams will also post their site level analyses to their
            preregistered OSF pages.

**Authorship Requirements and Current Contributions** When you sign up
to contribute to this study, you must agree to our [Collaboration
Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WZq-_59zNGGGVSmrtBfGQPWQuY9clsH4ImXjdspHF8k/edit?usp=sharing).
If you have any questions/concerns about this agreement, please email me
at <HallBF@hendrix.edu>. Contributors who collect a larger sample (N \>
100) and/or collect non-university participants will be given more
advanced authorship. Authors can be added to a Registered Replication
Report at different stages. Details about stage 1 author contributions
can be found in the manuscript in the \"Author Contributions\" section:
Preprint: <https://psyarxiv.com/zeux9>. ***What constitutes authorship
on the final manuscript?*** All authors must make contributions to
writing - review and editing (which involves approval of the submission)
and must also make contributions in at least one another category of the
[CRediT taxonomy](https://www.casrai.org/credit.html) (see table below).
"Writing - Review and Editing" minimally requires closely reading the
full manuscript, providing any relevant feedback and suggested edits,
and confirming approval of submission. Most authors will contribute to
"Investigation" and "Writing - Review & Editing." PIs of contributing
labs are responsible for their students and staff working on the
project. This includes: honestly reporting the contributions of their
lab members, evaluating whether contributions merit authorship according
to the above paragraph and the CRediT table below, and verifying that
contributions are correctly described in any formal publication. PIs are
also responsible for showing this agreement to lab members who will be
authors and making sure they agree to it. Author contributions will be
reported on research products (e.g., the Registered Report submission,
the final manuscript) using the [CRediT
taxonomy.](https://www.cell.com/pb/assets/raw/shared/guidelines/CRediT-taxonomy.pdf)
