March has been a particularly active month for the PSA, and we are
building serious momentum collecting data, preparing multiple studies to
begin data collection, and establishing new PSA policies around data
management and ethics approvals. The network also continues to grow (556
researchers, 446 laboratories, 65 countries)! Nick Coles is regularly
updating [this
map](https://nicholas-coles.shinyapps.io/PSA_Map_Prototype/){target="_blank"} to reflect our ever-expanding roster of
member researchers. If you don\'t see yourself or your lab on the map,
let us know! Congratulations and thank yous are in order for Chuan-Peng
Hu and Ilker Dalgar who will both be taking up roles as Assistant
Directors of the PSA for the Translation and Cultural Diversity
Committee. We will be working with Chuan-Peng and Ilker to, among other
things, identify translation coordinators for all PSA projects and to
further refine and improve our translation procedures. Thank you to
Oscar Oviedo Trespalacios who served this role for many months and was
integral in creating our initial PSA translation policies!

# **Study Updates**

-   001 FACE PERCEPTION. We\'ve collected data from over 7,000
    participants! This study is right on track to wrap up by the planned
    end of data collection in September.
-   002 OBJECT ORIENTATION & 003 GENDERED PREJUDICE. Labs are securing
    IRB approval and contributors are translating materials into their
    local languages.
-   004 TRUE BELIEF. Still under review. Fingers crossed!
-   005 STEREOTYPE THREAT. IRB materials have been drafted and put
    through a final review with the ethics committee. They will be
    shared with labs very soon.
-   006 TROLLEY PROBLEM. Over 80 labs have submitted IRB documents and
    40 have approval. We plan to submit the project as a stage 1
    registered report to Nature Human Behaviour on April 15th.

# Funding

-   Hans IJzerman is organizing a team to submit a European Research
    Council Synergy Grant application, and is recruiting researchers who
    are interested in leading one of the proposed research centers in
    Europe. You can read more about this opportunity and indicate your
    interest in getting involved
    [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3N6bTMXcNa3F4BhLcfo3IZ8v-ITGgRHqMSm_M8QPKb2TrNA/viewform){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
-   We have also started a crowd-funding campaign to pool monthly
    contributions into small (at first) stipends to support PSA labor
    that is currently being completed on a volunteer basis. Examples
    include translation, data management, project management, ethics
    review (and on and on and on). You can see the ongoing campaign
    info, and contribute if you are willing and able, at the [PSA
    Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/psysciacc){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"}. Thanks to those who have already
    generously donated, we can begin the process of selecting recipients
    and paying these stipends next month!

# Policy Documents

-   A group led by Patrick Forscher has drafted a very nice and
    extensive set of [data management guidelines for the
    PSA](https://psyarxiv.com/buqyc){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"}. This policy document has been voted on
    and approved by the Data and Methods Committee, but they remain open
    to your feedback on all things data management and data release. One
    important element of the guidelines is to identify a data manager
    for every PSA project. If you are interested in data management, you
    can check out [this tweet
    thread](https://twitter.com/PsySciAcc/status/1108415904851918851){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"} to learn a bit more and find out how to
    get involved in a data management role for the PSA.
-   The Ethics Committee is drafting a brief policy document to clarify
    our plans for documenting situations where labs do not require local
    ethical approval to conduct a PSA study. You can see the draft
    policy statement, and the conversation surrounding it in [this
    google
    doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DgOS6Q2X9ICpjM_DBHW506-sAlUjIvmxV1I0bdTt_iU/edit){target="_blank"
