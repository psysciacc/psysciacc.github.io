Partnership with CREP: 

::: {.wp-block-group .mt-0 .has-no-padding}
::: wp-block-group__inner-container
We have decided to partner with CREP again for 2021! We would like you
to help us pick our next study to replicate as one big happy network of
students and scholars!

Every year CREP selects 1-3 studies to replicate. This year, we\'ve
narrowed it down to 100 papers from 2018, but we want students to help
us with the rest. Students can contribute by going to the link below and
following the instructions to rate papers. They can do as many as
they\'d like between now and March 15!

<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScW8vt-KUlAIbLXQYMPGoai-4LYc-uWbqqwQ9URmF2A8s0A7g/viewform>

SO! How can you get involved if you are not a student? Please
incorporate this into one of your classes and ask your students for
participation. If you would like to know which of your students
participates then have them list your information on the form. After
March 15, Jordan Wagge will send a list of the students who participate
(and how many studies they rate) to any instructors on the list.

**Questions?** Please email crep.psych@gmail.com.

Thank you

Elections For Director and Associate Director: 

The PSA is currently in the process of electing a new Director and one
Associate Director. These positions will be filled by a direct election
from the PSA network. PSA leadership has received all of the nominations
(self or others) for these roles and we plan to conduct the election
process over the next two months. Each nominated individual has until
March 15 to write a 1000 word statements to support their candidacy.
Shortly after March 15, we will make the candidate statements available
in the PSA Slack.  If you have any questions about the election process
or what's involved in the positions, contact Heather Urry, at
<heather.urry@tufts.edu>.

Appointments:

We have 4 new assistant directors appointed. We are very excited to see
what each of them will bring to the table. 

**Miguel Silan - Assistant Director of Community Building and Network
Expansion**

Miguel Silan is a psychological science researcher with a focus on
meta-methodology (how do we know what we know and why do we do what we
do?). He is studying issues in ontology, philosophy of psychometrics and
the nature of fuzzy constructs. With the PSA he is scrutinizing the
vulnerabilities of cross-cultural studies, and consequently, rethinking
the possibilities in how to approach multi-site studies and other
large-scale collaborations.

As assistant director for the CBNEC, he plans for the committee to have
a more purposive and systematic community expansion approach --
especially in recruiting from developing countries and underrepresented
world regions. Further, with CBNEC, he is looking forward to
implementing a roster of community engagement events (including our
beloved coffee socials), as well as community assessment to aid in
sustainably applying initiatives from other committees (ex. financial
schemes).

**Maximilian Primbs - Assistant Director of Translation and Cultural
Diversity**

Maximilian is a second year Research Master student in Behavioural
Science at Radboud University, the Netherlands. After learning about the
PSA through an interview he conducted with Chuan-Peng Hu, Max joined the
PSA as language-wise coordinator for German for PSA006. After a very
positive experience with 006, he decided to work on the PSACR project
series and ended up coordinating the translation process for the
project. In his term as Assistant Director of Translation and Cultural
Diversity he wants to focus on standardising the PSA translation process
by creating standard templates and implementation workflows. Moreover,
he wants to increase the cultural diversity of the PSA by recruiting
students to work on PSA projects. His work outside the PSA is focussed
on stereotypes, visual perception, and on the analysis of reaction time
data. In his free time, he enjoys fitness, boxing, and playing Dungeon
and Dragons (the first two pre-lockdown

**Biljana Gjoneska - Assistant Director of Ethics**

"I discovered the world of PSA, when I first learned about a
multinational study investigating morality across the world ([PSA
006](https://psysciacc.org/006-trolley-problem/)). The deontological and
utilitarian principles explored in different moral dilemmas across many
countries, were evocative of medical ethics principles acquired over the
course of my undergraduate studies: "*primum nil nocere*" (i.e., "first,
do not harm") and "*primum optime curare*" (i.e., "first, secure optimal
treatment"). So, I was instantly drawn to the world of PSA.

I discovered the core PSA principles, when I attended the first
conference ([PSACON](https://psysciacc.org/psacon2020-videos/)). This is
where I realized that the topics discussed and the idea I was presenting
(about a public auction of proposals) were all grounded on the same
principles: *scientific rigor* and *openness to criticism*,
*transparency* and *decentralized authority*, *diversity* and
*inclusion*. The most humane and most basic ethics was at the root of
them all.

I discovered the PSA community, when I was closely collaborating on a
chapter about PSA (as promising resource for [clinical
psychologists](https://psyarxiv.com/qwy4k/)). I realized that some moral
foundations that I studied over the course of my doctorate studies, like
*fairness* and *reciprocity*, *care* and *sharing*, were the shared
characteristics of all my colleagues and PSA members. 

The PSA Ethics Committee comes as a next logical step. I can't hardly
wait to embark on this journey, and I promise to hold all of the
mentioned principles and to cherish all people and opinions."

**Jessica Flake - Assistant Director of Methods**

JK Flake has been an active member of the PSA from the beginning. She
worked with Chris Chartier and Patrick Forscher to develop a data and
methods committee for the PSA and was the methodologist for PSA001. Her
work with the data and methods committee has focused on ensuring
methodological rigor of PSA studies and making the PSA an avenue for
contributing methodological innovations to the field of psychology.
Currently she is leading the PSA's first ever large-scale measurement
invariance study and working with the data and methods committee to
further our metascience research and support of accepted studies with
methodologists.
