Call for Translators!

The Community building and Network Expansion Committee has created an
infographic to help recruit members to the PSA from underpopulated
regions. We are asking for some people to assist our committee by
translating these for recruitment materials (2-4 pages of materials) in
the following languages: Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Arabic, Portuguese,
Bangladesh, and Russia (Other languages are optional if we have people
who would like to recruit in their own language)

If you or someone you know would be able to help please reach out to

Miguel Silan (MiguelSilan@gmail.com) or

Maximilian Primbs (maximilian.primbs@gmx.de).

Swiss Psychology Open

We want to let you know of an exciting opportunity with the Swiss
Psychology Open. The Swiss Psychology open is a new open-access journal
that focuses on advancing and supporting best practices in psychological
science and teaching. SPS has released two special calls for papers, one
of which relates to \"big team science\". The call allows for very
practically oriented submissions on logistics, technical implementation,
and legal challenges. For more information you can check out the call
