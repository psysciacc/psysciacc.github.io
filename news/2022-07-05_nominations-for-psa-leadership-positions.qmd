**Associate Directors**

Associate Directors serve on the Board of Directors, which serves as the
steering body of the PSA. Typically, they meet 1-2 times a month with an
assigned committee, help the committee perform essential tasks, and
serve as a liaison between the committee and the Board of Directors.
They also attend a Board of Directors meeting every three weeks.The
estimated time commitment is 4-5 hours per month. For more information,
please contact the current Director (ncoles@stanford.edu).

**Assistant Director of Project Monitoring**

The Project Monitoring Committee consists of two assistant directors and
a larger team who actively serve as project monitors of PSA studies and
provide general feedback about PSA project procedures. The committee
meets twice a month, wherein committee members share project updates,
troubleshoot problems, and discuss project management strategies.
Assistant Directors are responsible for coordinating these twice-a-month
meetings and for regularly communicating updates to the PSA Board of
Directors. For more information, contact the current Assistant Director
(<david.vaidis@u-paris.fr>).

**Assistant Director of the Study Selection Committee **

The Study Selection Committee consists of two assistant directors and a
small team that is tasked with reviewing and selecting projects for the
PSA. Study proposals that pass an initial quality and feasibility check
by the committee are then reviewed by members of the advisory committees
and internal and external content experts. For more information, contact
the current Assistant Director (<kathleenschmidt1@gmail.com>).

**Assistant Director of the Funding Committee **

The Funding Committee works with the PSA Board of Directors on grant
applications, money management, and the developing of the PSA funding
strategy. The Funding Committee also offers occasional support to PSA
study investigators in funding applications. For more information,
contact the current Assistant Director (nlewisjr@cornell.edu).

**Assistant Director of the Ethics Committee**

The PSA Ethics Committee helps ensure high quality assessment and
identification of ethical risks or challenges, as well as protection and
safeguarding of ethical practices of PSA research projects. In the
broadest sense, the committee is responsible to: 1) provide reviews of
proposed PSA projects with an eye toward ethics, 2) provide
ethics-oriented consultation to selected PSA projects (e.g., co-develop
the material to ensure hassle-free approval in the majority of PSA
labs), 3) curates ethics procedures towards successful implementation of
ongoing PSA projects (especially related to the IRB and ethics review
board materials prior to distribution to the larger PSA group), 4) work
with other PSA committees to ensure ethical practices. For more
information, contact dana.basnightbrown@gmail.com.

**Assistant Director of the Translation and Cultural Diversity
Committee**

The Translation and Cultural Diversity committee coordinates
translations for each PSA project, expands the PSA community by
recruiting translators, and helps ensure that PSA members from every
country are treated fairly and equally.

**Assistant Director of the Community Building Committee**

The Community Building and Network Expansion Committee (CBNEC) is tasked
with engaging, assessing and expanding the PSA Network ("improve the
reach of and access to the PSA, both internally and externally" Moshontz
et al., 2018 pg. 511). The Assistant Directors provide the long-term
vision for the committee and coordinates its daily/monthly operations.
