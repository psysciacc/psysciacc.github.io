Accelerators,

We are now ready to have our first election for Associate Director! All registered members of the PSA are eligible to vote. To cast your ballot, simply login to the PSA site using your username and password (https://member.psysciacc.org/). The link to vote should appear on the homepage under Your Tasks (and disappear once you've voted). You can cast your ballot anytime between now and August 31.
