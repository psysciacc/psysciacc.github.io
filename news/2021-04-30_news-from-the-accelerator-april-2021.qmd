**Study updates:**

-   **PSA-002: Object Orientation & PSA-003: Gendered Prejudice-.**
    PSA-002 & -003 are finishing up data collection for English-speaking
    labs this month. We anticipate finishing data collection for
    non-English speaking labs by the end of May and will draft the Stage
    2 report shortly afterward.
-   **PSA-004: Accelerated CREP-** 004 has completely finished data
    collection! The leadership team and other volunteers have begun the
    process of data processing, pre-processing work, and working on
    final reviews for finished labs.
-   **PSA-005: Stereotype Threat-** We are waiting on vaccine
    distribution to get to a place that allows in-person data collection
    again. This summer, we will evaluate whether in-person data
    collection is likely to be feasible in Fall 2021.
-   **PSA-006: Trolley Problem-** This project is coming close to an end
    as we have submitted the manuscript! Now we are waiting to hear more
    from the reviewers.
-   **PSA-007: SPAM-L-** The 007 Canvas Website is in use. We have
    rolled out the three pre-projects and have had several people
    already contribute so far!! If you would like to contribute to the
    pre-projects, please email Erin Buchanan (buchananlab@gmail.com).
-   **PSA-COVID Rapid Bundle (001/002/003)-** PSACR is now focused on
    getting manuscripts written, revised, and submitted. PSACR-001 is
    revising their manuscript based on team feedback. PSACR-002 has been
    accepted with minor revisions at Nature Human Behavior, and all
    co-authors are reviewing the submission and updating their
    authorship information over the next 10 days. PSACR-003 is revising
    their manuscript based on team feedback. Erin Buchannan is also
    drafting a data paper that describes the method of the bundled
    project. Once this manuscript is ready, we will share the draft with
    the entire PSACR team (i.e., all data collection labs, translators,
    etc.), who are invited to serve as co-authors.

##### **A note from the amazing Charlie Ebersole (former Interim Director)**

Over the last few months, I got to see the PSA from a new perspective,
serving as its interim director. I came into this role through a very
competitive process among the Associate Directors - that being that I
was the only one who wasn't currently teaching and/or raising very small
children. In hindsight, though, I'm incredibly grateful for this
somewhat random opportunity. I gained a lot from this experience, but
what I will take most from it is hope. I am more hopeful than I have
been in some time for psychological research, researchers, and our
ability to maybe make the world a bit better. That's because of you all.

The greatest strength of the PSA is our collective knowledge and effort.
I knew that before I served as director. However, I didn't realize just
how strong we were as a network. The PSA is filled with more smart,
talented, hard-working people that actually want to improve things than
I had ever gotten to see before. It is genuinely inspiring. There is
more knowledge and experience in this group than I could ever hope to
acquire in a career, and I'm thankful that I got to learn from more of
you over the last few months.

There are a lot of issues that the PSA will continue to grapple with.
We've struggled to live up to some of our values in terms of global
representativeness at all levels of the organization. Finding funding
continues to be difficult. However, I feel very confident that we'll be
able to overcome the challenges we face and continue to build a
stronger, more impactful, and more inclusive network. That confidence
comes from working with you all. You are an incredible group of scholars
and humans. It was my honor to serve as director of such a great
collection of people.

Thanks everyone, Charlie

there are positions to fill. As we collectively wish Nicholas, Erin, and
Lisa well in their new roles, let\'s also offer our thanks and kudos to
all the candidates for their willingness to throw their hats into the
ring. I'm sure I'm not alone in appreciating the great ideas and
thoughts that went into the statements and conversations on Slack. THANK

**A special thank you to Heather Urry**

We also would like to thank the amazing Heather Urry
([\@HeatherUrry](https://twitter.com/HeatherUrry)) for coordinating
these elections. This was the biggest election process that the PSA has
seen so far, and she did a FANTASTIC job coordinating everything. To
give you an idea of her contribution to this election, we have listed a
few tasks that she worked on during this process (This is not a complete
list of her contributions). She managed the nominations, contacted each
of the nominations to see if they were still interested, collected and
distributed the statements, answered questions about the process,
created each candidate\'s Slack channels, kept the entire network up to
date and in the loop, set up the election ballot, and analyzed the
election outcome data. So, if you have a moment to send Heather a Slack,
direct message, or email, please thank her for her amazing work to make
this election happen!

**Community Building and Network Expansion**

We have implemented monthly social events to allow new members to get
integrated into our community. Everyone is welcome to join these
meetings to get to know other members in our network. Here is the
[link](https://ashlanduniversity.zoom.us/j/93076610476) for each
month\'s meeting! We will post the dates for each month on the PSA
gcal. 

If you want to keep up to date with the various events that are
happening on the PSA Network, subscribe to our calendar via
[Gmail](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-subscribe-to-a-google-calendar)
or
[Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/import-google-calendar-to-outlook-098ed60c-936b-41fb-83d6-7e3786437330),
depending on what you use! [This should be the link to the
calendar.](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=snln35l2i6o1pn3uubrgv3qd10%40group.calendar.google.com)

Another initiative the CBNE committee is implementing is Community
Energizing threads- informal Slack threads to help members get to know
each other better, their works, ideas, approaches, etc. \[Similar to the
idea of 'themed discussion days\' on certain subreddits, if you\'re
familiar with Reddit\]. The community building committee thought it was
a good time to bring it back! Absolutely all members are welcome to join
in. Feel free to make the thread messy, especially if you want to reply
to the responses you find to be interesting, or with topics you find
similar interests on. We will be posting these periodically so be on the
lookout for these threads.
