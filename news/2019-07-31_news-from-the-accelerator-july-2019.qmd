We have a range of updates and small requests for help this month,
including paper submissions, an upcoming data release, elections,
hackathons, and a crowdfunding campaign.

## **Current Studies** {#current-studies .entry-title}

-   [001 Face
    Perception](https://psysciacc.org/001-face-perception/){target="_blank"}.
    We are nearly done with data collection in all world regions! We
    will release a simulated data set in August, complete data
    collection in October, release \~1/3 of the data set in late October
    as an exploratory segment, and then release the remaining \~2/3 of
    the data set as a confirmatory segment concurrently with the release
    of the Stage 2 manuscript at *Nature Human Behaviour*.
-   [002 Object
    Orientation](https://psysciacc.org/002-object-orientation/){target="_blank"}
    & [003 Gendered
    Prejudice](https://psysciacc.org/003-gendered-prejudice/){target="_blank"}.
    Data collection is now rolling out in English speaking labs and will
    expand to the other study languages soon if all goes smoothly with
    the early collection sessions.
-   [004 True
    Belief](https://psysciacc.org/004-true-belief/){target="_blank"}.
    Data collection is also currently rolling out for this project as
    labs test their lab-specific links and get a final check on all
    materials.
-   [005 Stereotype
    Threat](https://psysciacc.org/005-stereotype-threat/){target="_blank"}.
    The Stage 1 Registered Report
    [manuscript](https://psyarxiv.com/6hju9){target="_blank"} is now
    under review at *Nature Human Behaviour*. We still [welcome new labs
    to
    join](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScMFuuVepTdSC5Bnwh5nYyRqbYKOF7l3u5pfhBG0IlOHhIffw/viewform){target="_blank"}
    the project if they are based in the USA and can recruit black
    college students.
-   [006 Trolley
    Problem](https://psysciacc.org/006-trolley-problem/){target="_blank"}.
    The Stage 1 Registered Report
    [manuscript](https://psyarxiv.com/9uaqm/){target="_blank"} received
    a favorable \"revise and resubmit\" from *Nature Human Behaviour*.
    The lead team is currently working on the revisions and will reach
    out to all co-authors for feedback and suggested edits soon.
-   007 and beyond? Remember that the deadline for submissions to [this
    year's round of study
    selection](https://psysciacc.org/2019/06/15/the-psychological-science-accelerator-calls-for-study-submissions/){target="_blank"}
    is September 15th!

## **Funding**

PSA members are actively working on a range of grant submissions to the
US National Science Foundation, the John Templeton Foundation, the
European Research Council Synergy program, and Canada\'s National
Research Council, but there are probably other opportunities for us to
pursue. If you know of a funding mechanism that would be a good fit for
the PSA, please pass along any information you have, and let us know if
you'd like to lead the grant writing effort or collaborate on a
submission!

## **Patreon**

Remember that we can also support the PSA via our [Patreon
page](https://www.patreon.com/psysciacc){target="_blank"}. Even just \$1
a month can be extremely helpful and provide meaningful funding if we
get a large base of supporters. I've given myself the challenge of
getting the PSA one new Patreon supporter every workday. I've been
successful for the past week, and I hope to keep the streak going for a
very long time! Perhaps you could find a new supporter each year? Each
month? Each week? Every little bit helps.

## **Hackathons**

We have been holding weekly PSA hackathons for the last three weeks and
plan to continue these for the foreseeable future. They\'ve been
extremely fun, productive, and energizing! The three previous hack
topics were \"brainstorming funding sources,\" \"editing our needs
assessment process for new studies,\" and \"updating and organizing our
file management system.\" This Friday, August 2nd, at 14:00 UTC we will
host a hackathon on improving our [get
involved](https://psysciacc.org/get-involved/){target="_blank"} page on
[psysciacc.org](https://psysciacc.org/){target="_blank"}. We will
announce all future hackathons on twitter and on the new #hackathons
slack channel. Let us know if you have any ideas or requests for future
sessions.

## **Meta-Policy**

We have drafted a new PSA policy defining the process by which the PSA
creates and approves new policies :). We now welcome feedback on this
policy before we put it up for a vote. Please provide your comments in
the next two weeks in the [draft
document.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14D6GrE4i7FJejq_BUZ9DPC2bQfCb2PztdEB63QldOow/edit){target="_blank"}

## **Elections**

PSA elections for Assistant Directors, Associate Directors, and the
Director will begin in January 2020 and then be held each subsequent
July and January. During each election, we will select 3 Assistant
Directors (who serve 3 year terms). Most elections will also select an
Associate Director (who serve 4 year terms). We will elect a new
Director every 5 years. You can see more details about the upcoming
elections, including the initial schedule (which was selected randomly),
towards the bottom of [this policy
document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aXjXwouFc6wvcyy7IFmEKGL0j2yxzYukyI_YFf6sZtM/edit){target="_blank"}.
More details on election specifics are coming soon! Â  -That's all for
this month. Be on the lookout for some exciting posts and updates during
August as we celebrate 2 years of accelerating psychological science
(our anniversary is August 26th). I'll leave you with two pictures of
PSA members meeting up (one online and one in person) and making each
other smile about the future of psychological science!
