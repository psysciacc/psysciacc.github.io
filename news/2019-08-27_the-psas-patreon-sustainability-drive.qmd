The PSA owes its success to the enthusiasm of its members. That
enthusiasm has led to an outpouring of volunteer work hours. In 2019, we
estimate that these hours total 19,390, equivalent to approximately 10
full-time people per year. However, enthusiastic volunteerism has its
limits. First, some items, such as software licenses and compensation
for participants, cannot be bought solely with volunteer labor. Second,
volunteer time necessarily comes at the expense of time spent on other
activities \-- activities that more directly benefit one's career. Thus,
for the PSA to maximize its positive impact, it needs to develop a broad
set of reliable funding streams, both to enable special projects that
require direct funding and to guard against the eventuality that
enthusiasm for the PSA diminishes. That's where you come in. We have
recently created a [Patreon
page](https://www.patreon.com/psysciacc){target="_blank"} to allow
interested people to make regular contributions to help the PSA fulfill
its goals. The exact items that we fund with the Patreon will change on
a regular basis; however, we have made a pledge that all the money we
receive through this Patreon page will be reinvested into the PSA in a
way that directly supports our mission and is in line with our core
principles. In the coming year, we hope to use the Patreon to fund two
items, both of which will be discussed further in a blog post of their
own later this week:

1.  **Six grants of \$400** to PSA member labs who wish to collect data
    for one of our studies but lack the resources to do so
2.  **Six stipends of \$400** to help compensate people who take on
    study-specific administrative roles

We will feel comfortable funding these if our Patreon reaches the
threshold of **\$400 per month** by **Tuesday September 3, 5pm UTC**. We
will provide regular updates as to our progress. If you are able to
donate a monthly contribution and you think our goal is worthy,
[consider becoming a
patron](https://www.patreon.com/psysciacc){target="_blank"}. Even \$1 a
month gets us closer to your goal. Help us reach our goal and thereby
incrementally advance the improvement of psychological science!
