:::

The PSA is slowly integrating our new membership website to Canvas.
Canvas is designed for teaching, so many of the terms online are focused
on teaching - but we plan to explore Canvas as a project management
tool. We have officially added every PSA member to the system. You
should get an email in the next couple of weeks saying you have been
added to our PSA membership course. You should also receive an email
containing a guide for how to navigate this new membership website
