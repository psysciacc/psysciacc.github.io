<p>The PSA is slowly integrating our new membership website to Canvas. Canvas is designed for teaching, so many of the terms online are focused on teaching - but we plan to explore Canvas as a project management tool. We have officially added every PSA member to the system. You should get an email in the next couple of weeks saying you have been added to our PSA membership course. You should also receive an email containing a guide for how to navigate this new membership website</p>
