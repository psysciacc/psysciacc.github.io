## **Study updates:**

-   **PSA-002 (Object Orientation) PSA-003 (Gendered Prejudice):** The
    002/003 team is happy to report that as of 6/1, we are completing
    data collection for the project. There are a few labs who are still
    in the process of finishing up, but we anticipate that all data
    collection for the project will draw to a close within a week. The
    lead teams will begin data processing and analysis shortly
    thereafter.
-   **PSA-004 (Accelerated CREP):** The leadership team is currently
    working on data processing, data analysis, and authorship credit
    tracking.
-   **PSA-005 (Stereotype Threat):** We are waiting on vaccine
    distribution to get to a place that allows in-person data collection
    again. This summer the leadership team will evaluate whether
    in-person data collection is feasible in Fall 2021.
-   **PSA-006 (Trolley Problem):** The Stage II submission has received
    a revise-and-resubmit from *Nature Human Behavior*.
-   **PSA-007 (SPAM-L):** SPAML is currently in its beginning stages and
    recruiting collaborators for a variety of pre-project tasks. More
    information about these tasks can be found
    [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xslViVFZrapUG75mwsF2eijFoQqm5GABoOf9ekIweH4/edit?usp=sharing)

    hosted by Erin and Savannah.
-   **PSA-COVID Rapid Bundle (001/002/003)-**
    -   001: is submitted to PNAS. A preprint will be uploaded in the
        near future.
    -   002: the revised Stage II manuscript will soon be resubmitted to
        Nature Human Behavior
    -   003: the proposing authors are currently incorporating feedback
        from the PSA network.

## **Webinar **

On June 17th 10-11:30 AM Eastern Pacific, we will be hosting a summer
symposium titled \"Revisiting the role of demand characteristics in
social science research\". More information
[here](https://stanford.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_J0tfhbNRQwG7UowpyEPekA).
All are welcome! 

## **CREP Collaborations**

Please help us decide on the next Accelerated CREP Study!  

Accelerated CREP is a joint effort between the PSA and the Collaborative
Replications and Education Project (osf.io/wfc6u).  You can learn about
our first study, PSA 004 True Belief, here:
<https://psyarxiv.com/zeux9/>. We are asking interested PSA members to
vote on the next collaboration. More information (and a link to voting)
is available
[here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdle_CXUwE4mEi4fAtBuAexYujzLulSMik-C95OLKrQk2eIEg/viewform).

## **PSACON 2021**

\
The preparations for this year's edition of the PSA conference (PSACON
2021) are underway. We have a fresh new team of PSA members who will
serve in their capacity as organizing committee who volunteered to
dedicate some of their time to the organization of the event. If you are
interested in serving on this committee you are welcome to reach out to
any of the following members. The team thus far consists of an amazing
group of people in our organization.

We've kept the best parts of PSACON2020! Much like last year, interested
individuals can sponsor another attendee's registration while paying for
their own. PSACON2021 will be hosting a wide variety of events,
including PSA studies, presentations from our collaborators, hackathons,
and coffee hour sessions. As the organizing committee delves into the
process of putting out a call for presenters, we hope to welcome
increasingly creative ways of talking about science during a virtual
conference. More details about the schedule, the format of the
conference, and sending in presentations will be sent around mid-June!

As part of our planning for this virtual event, we are asking you to
help us in making a joint, informed decision regarding some important
organizational aspects. You can do this by filling out [this
poll](https://forms.gle/TSwNpCQYfMjQJ9TB9). Please make your voice
heard, and we hope to see you at this year\'s conference!
