It has been an exciting month for the PSA! You can also stay up to date
by subscribing to the
[blog](https://psysciacc.org/blog/){target="_blank"}, following us on
[twitter](https://twitter.com/PsySciAcc){target="_blank"}, signing up
for our [email
list](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_x9UNOjUkaKFJZjOXdaQ9OsTUtUliwZFZRmoNSr9zh78Ldg/viewform){target="_blank"},
or joining our slack workspace. For January, we have updates on peer
review decisions for our projects, in-progress studies, and new ways to
communicate with PSA leadership and stay informed on our activities.

# Favorable peer review decisions!

We have just received an in principle acceptance for "[Investigating
object orientation effects across 14
languages](https://psyarxiv.com/t2pjv/){target="_blank"}" at
*Psychonomic Bulletin and Review*. Congratulations to Sau-Chin Chen,
Anna Szabelska, and all of our co-authors! We will now plan for data
collection and share updates soon.

.size-full .wp-image-359 width="1024" height="594"} We also recently
received a favorable revise and resubmit decision for \"[Accelerated
CREP: RRR: Turri, Buckwalter, & Blouw
(2015)](https://psyarxiv.com/zeux9){target="_blank"}\" at *Advances in
Methods and Practices in Psychological Science*. Braeden Hall and Jordan
Wagge have been leading the revision efforts and will resubmit the
manuscript soon.

# Lab recruitment for moral thinking study

We are [recruiting labs](https://t.co/wRxvjJcygd){target="_blank"} for
"[On the universality of moral thinking: Cross-cultural variation in the
influence of personal force and intention in moral dilemma
judgments](https://osf.io/d2ptq/){target="_blank"}." The current list of
contributing labs is up to 105 sites representing 42 countries! This is
a great start, but we still welcome additional labs to join the team. We
will likely submit this project as a Registered Report, so the size and
diversity of our team will strengthen our Stage 1 submission and chances
of securing an in principle acceptance.

# Data collection

Data collection continues for "[To which world regions does the
valence-dominance model apply](https://psyarxiv.com/n26dy)." We have now
collected data from over 2,000 participants across 48 labs. More labs
and more languages of collection are going \"live\" every day and we
will continue the project through September. You can see demo versions
of all active languages
[here](https://psa.psy.gla.ac.uk/){target="_blank"}.

# Staying up to date on PSA activities

We have started an [\"on-deck\"
document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eBz7QDZ5ZS0Zal_TmfyNs1sbMo08liXUokth2OA2ml8/edit#gid=0){target="_blank"}
that summarizes the various active projects and work of the PSA. If you
are wondering what activities could use extra person-power or what the
leadership team is working on, this document is a great place to look!
We will try to make it more detailed and helpful in the coming days, as
well as keep it as up to date as possible. Chris will be hosting monthly
Q&A sessions for PSA members via google hangouts. If you\'ve been on the
\"sidelines\", are not sure how to get more actively involved in the
PSA, or have any questions about our policies, processes, or current
studies, please join in on an upcoming call to have your questions
answered! The times for the meetings will vary considerably from month
to month to allow for members from all of our different time zones to
have opportunities to join. The first hangout will be Monday, February
25th, 17:00 UTC. You can join the call at [this
link](https://hangouts.google.com/call/sGLii5qaWDF-vOh55WWQAEEE){target="_blank"}
(which we will also share via twitter just prior to the meeting). One
last random note: in the PSA [members' roster
spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pwqm0qARfTe44UuTnsCMiycpjNBso_cZh5fYR-D75Pg/edit#gid=1426871128),
we recently switched all lab IDs to 3 digit ISO codes. Lab IDs that were
being used for the faces study are being held constant for use in that
specific [tracking
sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eKbJGB4zpLBaNpUtJu9GJfmF4xtpIuZIty1sQIhWgfA/edit#gid=0)
and data collection process, but we will use the new ISO codes going
forward.

### Thank you for all of the continued efforts you have put into making the PSA a success!

### Chris
