<span style="font-weight:400;">It has been an exciting month for the PSA! You can also stay up to date by subscribing to the <a href="https://psysciacc.org/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog</a>, following us on <a href="https://twitter.com/PsySciAcc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">twitter</a>, signing up for our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_x9UNOjUkaKFJZjOXdaQ9OsTUtUliwZFZRmoNSr9zh78Ldg/viewform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email list</a>, or joining our slack workspace. For January, we have updates on peer review decisions for our projects, in-progress studies, and new ways to communicate with PSA leadership and stay informed on our activities.</span>
<h1>Favorable peer review decisions!</h1>
<span style="font-weight:400;">We have just received an in principle acceptance for “</span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/t2pjv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Investigating object orientation effects across 14 languages</a><span style="font-weight:400;">” at </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Psychonomic Bulletin and Review</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">. Congratulations to Sau-Chin Chen, Anna Szabelska, and all of our co-authors! We will now plan for data collection and share updates soon.</span>

<span style="font-weight:400;">We also recently received a favorable revise and resubmit decision for "<a href="https://psyarxiv.com/zeux9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Accelerated CREP: RRR: Turri, Buckwalter, &amp; Blouw (2015)</a>" </span><span style="font-weight:400;">at </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">. Braeden Hall and Jordan Wagge have been leading the revision efforts and will resubmit the manuscript soon.</span>
<h1>Lab recruitment for moral thinking study</h1>
<span style="font-weight:400;">We are </span><a href="https://t.co/wRxvjJcygd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruiting labs</a><span style="font-weight:400;"> for “</span><a href="https://osf.io/d2ptq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On the universality of moral thinking: Cross-cultural variation in the influence of personal force and intention in moral dilemma judgments</a><span style="font-weight:400;">.” The current list of contributing labs is up to 105 sites representing 42 countries! This is a great start, but we still welcome additional labs to join the team. We will likely submit this project as a Registered Report, so the size and diversity of our team will strengthen our Stage 1 submission and chances of securing an in principle acceptance. </span>
<h1>Data collection</h1>
<span style="font-weight:400;">Data collection continues for “</span><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/n26dy"><span style="font-weight:400;">To which world regions does the valence-dominance model apply</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.” We have now collected data from over 2,000 participants across 48 labs. More labs and more languages of collection are going "live" every day and we will continue the project through September. You can see demo versions of all active languages <a href="https://psa.psy.gla.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</span>
<h1>Staying up to date on PSA activities</h1>
<span style="font-weight:400;">We have started an <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eBz7QDZ5ZS0Zal_TmfyNs1sbMo08liXUokth2OA2ml8/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"on-deck" document</a> that summarizes the various active projects and work of the PSA. If you are wondering what activities could use extra person-power or what the leadership team is working on, this document is a great place to look! We will try to make it more detailed and helpful in the coming days, as well as keep it as up to date as possible.</span>

Chris will be hosting monthly Q&amp;A sessions for PSA members via google hangouts. If you've been on the "sidelines", are not sure how to get more actively involved in the PSA, or have any questions about our policies, processes, or current studies, please join in on an upcoming call to have your questions answered! The times for the meetings will vary considerably from month to month to allow for members from all of our different time zones to have opportunities to join. The first hangout will be Monday, February 25th, 17:00 UTC. You can join the call at <a href="https://hangouts.google.com/call/sGLii5qaWDF-vOh55WWQAEEE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this link  </a> (which we will also share via twitter just prior to the meeting).

<span style="font-weight:400;">One last random note: in the PSA </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pwqm0qARfTe44UuTnsCMiycpjNBso_cZh5fYR-D75Pg/edit#gid=1426871128"><span style="font-weight:400;">members’ roster spreadsheet</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">, we recently switched all lab IDs to 3 digit ISO codes. Lab IDs that were being used for the faces study are being held constant for use in that specific </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eKbJGB4zpLBaNpUtJu9GJfmF4xtpIuZIty1sQIhWgfA/edit#gid=0"><span style="font-weight:400;">tracking sheet</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;"> and data collection process, but we will use the new ISO codes going forward.</span>
<h3>Thank you for all of the continued efforts you have put into making the PSA a success!</h3>
