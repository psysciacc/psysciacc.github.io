## Evaluation Criteria

At Gorilla, we are committed to a fair and thorough review process. A
select panel of team members will evaluate all applications within
approximately 2–3 weeks after the application deadline.

To ensure impartiality, applications will be anonymized. The team will
first filter out low-quality submissions and those from existing Gorilla
users. Each remaining application will then be scored (out of 5) based
on:

-   Motivation – Is the study well-supported by literature?
-   Feasibility – Can the study be effectively built in Gorilla?
-   Content Interest – Will the final study create engaging content for
    social media and webinars?

The reviewers will then meet to discuss the highest-rated applications,
selecting five winners. Additionally, the top \~15% of applicants will
be recognized as runner-ups.

## Grant Winners

Gorilla will notify all applicants of their results. 5 Winners will each
receive:

-   A complimentary Gorilla Researcher Standard subscription (valued at
    \$1,470)
-   Approximately \$250\* in cash

In addition to their complementary subscription, winners will also be
invited to an exclusive study mapping session with a Gorilla Research
Specialist, along with dedicated support to set up their Gorilla and
partner accounts.

15-20\* Runner-Ups will be awarded:

-   A 50% discount on a Gorilla subscription
