Introducing the PSA001 Secondary Analysis Challenge.

We are offering up to 10 awards of \$200 to research teams that use data
from our first study
([PSA001](https://psyarxiv.com/n26dy){target="_blank"}) to follow an
analysis pipeline meeting our specifications. We describe the
background, rationale, and details below. *Background* Psychology
datasets contain a wealth of information, including dozens, hundreds,
and sometimes even thousands of variables. Datasets that are
well-documented can be even richer, as appropriate documentation can
allow these datasets to be merged with secondary information (or
*meta-data*), exponentially expanding the universe of possible analyses.
Although some researchers use publicly posted data in their research, we
believe the potential of secondary analyses is, as yet, untapped. Some
of this untapped potential may result from the typical structure of a
psychology dataset release. In the best case, the dataset is described
in an article in a journal (such as the [Journal of Open Psychology
Data](https://openpsychologydata.metajnl.com/){target="_blank"} or
[Scientific Data](https://www.nature.com/sdata/){target="_blank"}). In
the worst, the dataset is undocumented and only available on request (if
at all). We believe we can do better to make our datasets maximally
informative. *Phased dataset release (with incentives)* Our test case
for innovating with improving the data release process is
[PSA001](https://psyarxiv.com/n26dy){target="_blank"}, a project to test
whether the valence-dominance model of face perception generalizes
across world regions. The primary dataset contains ratings from over
11,000 participants across 11 world regions, 48 countries, and 28
languages. Each participant rated 120 faces twice on one of 13 traits.
In addition to these ratings, we have access to datasets containing
various meta-data. These include datasets of participant characteristics
(such as race and gender -- some locations only), site characteristics
(such as world region and institutional affiliation), and
characteristics of the faces that were rated (such as the gender of the
face, picture luminance, and the size of various facial features). In
our release of this dataset, we are following the lead of other high
quality data releases by carefully curating and documenting our
datasets. However, we are adding an extra innovation: we are structuring
the release in a way that we think will maximize the value of the
resulting secondary analyses. Specifically, we are releasing *separate*
exploratory and confirmatory segments of the data and *incentivizing*
the use of these separate segments by offering up to **10 awards of
\$200** to research teams who complete the analysis pipeline of
exploring with the exploratory segment, confirming with the confirmatory
segment, and sharing the results on
[PsyArXiv](https://psyarxiv.com/){target="_blank"}. *The details* The
data release plan for this project consists of three phases: release of
a simulated dataset (to allow people not directly involved in the
project time to understand the variables we collected), release of an
exploratory segment (⅓ of the full dataset), and release of a
confirmatory segment (the full dataset). We will stratify by lab when
creating our exploratory and confirmatory segments; in other words, we
will randomly sample ⅓ of the participants within each lab that
contributed data to create the exploratory segment. The full dataset
will demarcate the exploratory and confirmatory All data drops will
occur at randomly selected UTC times between 12am and 11pm. We will
provide up to 10 awards of \$200 each for research teams that make
secondary contributions from the exploratory and confirmatory datasets.
If more than 10 teams submit contributions the winners will be chosen at
random. To be eligible, a research team must:

-   Write a computationally reproducible script that analyzes the
    exploratory dataset. The script may be written in any data analysis
    software, but we strongly encourage the use of open-source software
    such as R.
-   Post the script to a project on the Open Science Framework and
    create a date-stamped preregistration of the script using [OSF
    preregistrations](https://osf.io/prereg/){target="_blank"}. The
    proposing teams can use a preregistration template, such as [this
    one for secondary data
    analysis](https://osf.io/v4z3x/){target="_blank"}, or they can use
    an open-ended preregistration that only contains the script that the
    team will use to analyze the confirmatory segment and a date stamp.
    At the top of the script, the proposing team should write their
    names and the following text: "I commit to analyzing the
    confirmatory segment of PSA001 Social Faces using this script upon
    the project's release". The date stamp of the preregistration must
    be before 12pm UTC, November 30, 2019, which is the point at which
    the confirmatory segment will be released. The script will be
    checked for computational reproducibility by a member of the PSA's
    [Data and Methods
    Committee](https://osf.io/x7e4m/){target="_blank"}.
-   After the release of the confirmatory segment, post a preprint to
    [PsyArXiv](https://psyarxiv.com/){target="_blank"} detailing the
    results of the analyses of the exploratory and confirmatory
    segments. To be eligible for the award, the preprint must be
    date-stamped by 12pm UTC, January 31, 2020. For the purposes of
    winning the award, the preprint may be very brief --tables or
    figures illustrating the results along with some descriptive text
    are sufficient. However, if the research team wishes, the preprint
    may be more detailed. The PsyArXiv preprint should be tagged with
    the study code for this project: "PSA001".

Before issuing the awards, members of the Data and Methods Committee
will verify that these steps have been followed. Below are the key dates
of this data release plan:

1.  The **simulated dataset**, along with a **codebook**, will be
    released (posted on OSF, tweeted, Facebooked, and blogged) on August
    31, 2019, 24:00 UTC, 8pm EST (so it's available today!!). It, along
    with detailed documentation of the dataset, are available at [this
    OSF page](https://osf.io/8xd7r/){target="_blank"}.
2.  The **exploratory segment** can be found
    [here](https://osf.io/yrveh/){target="_blank"}, and was posted on
    October 31, 2019, concurrent with the submission of this project's
    Stage 2 Registered Report.
3.  The **preregistered analyses** should be submitted via [this
    form](https://forms.gle/4UpUigozZtn7kMWh9){target="_blank"} by
    November 30, 2019, 12pm UTC.
4.  The **confirmatory segment** will be released concurrently with the
    publication of the Stage 2 paper at Nature Human Behaviour.
5.  The **preprint** should be posted within one month of the release of
    the confirmatory segment. Once posted, the preprint can be submitted
    to the PSA001 team via this
    [form](https://forms.gle/AdDjCbPY5z58anhn9){target="_blank"}.

If you have questions about this process, or the data that we have
available, contact the PSA001 data manager (Patrick S. Forscher) at
<schnarrd@gmail.com>. *Conclusion* We hope this project can serve as an
exemplar of how the details of data release can add value to the
scientific knowledge generated from a particular dataset. We hope you
consider participating in our Secondary Analysis Challenge so we can see
if this is indeed the case.
