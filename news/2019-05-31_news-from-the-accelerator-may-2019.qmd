This month we announce an upcoming call for studies, seek contributors
to several key committees, and give mini progress reports on all 6 of
our current studies.

## New Call for Studies Coming Soon

It is almost time for another round of study selection (our 3rd)! On
June 15th we will release a detailed call for studies post with our
updated submission guidelines. The deadline for study submissions will
be September 15th. To begin planning now, you can review our [prior call
for
studies](https://psysciacc.org/2018/04/30/the-psychological-science-accelerator-call-for-study-submissions-deadline-june-20th/){target="_blank"},
or reply to this email with any presubmission inquiries. We are excited
to see what great ideas are submitted this round!

## Committees Seeking Contributors

Several committees could use additional members to better support our
current studies, provide training for the PSA network, and to prepare
for our next round of study review and selection.

-   Ethics Committee: The Ethics Committee is seeking representation
    from the following broad geographic regions: Africa, Asia,
    Australia, and Central and South America. We are currently a group
    of 7; however, we are almost exclusively located in the US and
    Europe, and we want to meet the diverse needs of all PSA-represented
    regions and beyond. Currently, we have the following roles: 1)
    provide reviews of proposed PSA projects with an eye toward
    ethics, 2) provide reviews of accepted PSA project IRB and ethics
    review board materials prior to distribution to the larger PSA
    group, 3) provide ethics-oriented consultation to ongoing PSA
    projects, 4) work with other PSA committees to ensure ethical
    practices. Zoom-based meetings are approximately monthly. For more
    information and/or to submit a CV, please contact Erica Musser at
    emusser@fiu.edu.
-   Study Selection Committee: The Study Selection Committee serves a
    vital role in the workflow of the PSA by facilitating the review of
    proposed projects and ultimately deciding on their acceptance to be
    run by our network. We are currently seeking 2-4 new members to aid
    in our next round of selection in late summer and early fall of this
    year. Committee members must commit to serve for 1 year but may
    choose to resign at any point thereafter. Unlike many of the other
    PSA committees, the work of the Study Selection Committee is
    concentrated to a few months per year. The PSA solicits study
    proposal submissions on an ad hoc basis. After each call for
    submissions is closed, the Study Selection Committee evaluates the
    submissions for feasibility and general quality. We then vote on
    whether each proposal merits review. Suitable proposals are then
    reviewed by experts in and outside of the network. The Study
    Selection Committee compiles and synthesizes this feedback. The
    committee then makes the final selections on the basis of reviewers'
    responses, evaluations from the PSA network, and the PSA's mission,
    values and capacity. If you would like to join the committee, please
    submit a CV to committee co-chair and PSA Assistant Director
    Kathleen Schmidt (<kathleenschmidt1@gmail.com> or
    <kathleen.schmidt@siu.edu>).
-   Training Committee: The Training Committee is recruiting committee
    coordinators to help organize and provide trainings for the PSA and
    larger science community. If you are interested in joining our team,
    please read about our openings and apply! Link:

-   Translation Coordinator for Study 004, The Accelerated CREP Project:
    We are looking for a translation coordinator for PSA 004
    (Accelerated CREP) to coordinate and monitor the translations
    according to PSA's translation policies. The Accelerated CREP is a
    pedagogical project conducted by student teams in collaboration with
    faculty supervisors. The preprint of the registered report (under
    review and hopefully very close to an in principle acceptance at
    *AMPPS*) is available at
    https://psyarxiv.com/zeux9 . The study is currently translated into
    nine different languages and most of these are ready for the next
    step in the translation process (back translations and controlling
    for equivalence). The translation coordinator is expected to
    coordinate the remainder of the translation process and monitor
    them. The translation coordinator will earn authorship on the
    resulting manuscript.

## Postdoctoral Researcher Position

Tomorrow (June 1) is the last day to [apply for the PSA post-doc
position](https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/jobs/410163){target="_blank"}.
We (a team led by Hans IJzerman) are looking for a talented and
motivated postdoctoral researcher. The position is for two years and
will be hosted at LIP/PC2S at Université Grenoble Alpes. The position's
primary focus is to support the Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA:
[https://psysciacc.org](https://psysciacc.org/)) in grant writing. The
first priority for the postdoctoral researcher is to help write a
Synergy Grant (<https://erc.europa.eu/funding/synergy-grants>), where
the proposed co-PIs are John Ioannidis (Stanford University), Denny
Borsboom and Eric Jan Wagenmakers (University of Amsterdam), Lisa
DeBruine and Ben Jones (University of Glasgow), and Hans IJzerman
(Université Grenoble Alpes). The postdoctoral researcher will also be
involved in PSA-related research and will be involved in some
supervision of students who do PSA-related research. The candidate we
search should be an excellent writer and should have ample experience
with open science (and be familiar with R and/or Python). To read more
about context in which the postdoctoral researcher will be embedded,
please go to [www.corelab.io](http://www.corelab.io/).
