This month we have a few updates on our 6 studies, our search for
funding, and other interesting projects that PSA members may be
interested in.

## 001 FACE PERCEPTION

We have collected data from over 9,000 participants! There are two
regions that we could still use extra collection in: Africa and Central
America & Mexico. If you, or a colleague of yours, would be interested
in contributing to data collection in either region, please let us know
by replying to this email. Materials are ready, and this would be a
relatively quick way to contribute to a PSA study and earn authorship on
the *Nature Human Behaviour* paper! Additionally, we have funds for a
few (3-5) small (\$200-\$400) data collection grants if such an award
would make joining possible for you. [001

## 002 OBJECT ORIENTATION & 003 GENDERED PREJUDICE

Labs continue to secure IRB approval and contributors are translating
materials into their local languages. The last major step prior to
opening data collection for these studies is a pre-registration of the
003 analysis plan, which should be complete in the next few weeks! [002

## 004 TRUE BELIEF

We received a second, and relatively minor, revise and resubmit from
*Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science*. Braeden
Hall is leading the revision efforts, and we think we are quite close to
securing an in principle acceptance! [004

## 005 STEREOTYPE THREAT

Labs are securing IRB approval, the lead team is finalizing the adaptive
design that will be used to distribute participants across conditions,
and all collaborators are currently providing feedback on the Stage 1
Registered Report manuscript.

## 006 TROLLEY PROBLEM

After multiple rounds of contributor feedback, Bence and Balazs
submitted the Stage 1 Registered Report manuscript to *Nature Human
Behaviour*. Fingers crossed for a quick and positive peer review
experience, and congratulations to all co-authors on making it to this
big milestone for the project! Labs are securing IRB approval at a fast
rate, and we are just about to begin our translation process in earnest,
led by Chuan-Peng Hu, who will be coordinating translations for the
study. [006 Preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/9uaqm/){target="_blank"}

## GRANT APPLICATIONS

-   We should hear back on our NSF submission in the next few months. If
    we receive this grant, we will be able to hire 2 full time research
    coordinators.
-   The line-up is set for our Synergy grant submission. Hans IJzerman
    is leading a team including EJ Wagenmakers, Lisa DeBruine, Ben
    Jones, Denny Borsboom, and John Ioannidis in drafting this
    submission.
-   Bence Bag√≥, Balazs Aczel, and Rink Hoekstra are working on a grant
    application for the NWO replication stream to further expand the 006
    study to more non-student samples.
-   Neil Lewis Jr. is leading a team to apply for 005 project specific
    funding through the William T. Grant Foundation.
