The Psychological
Science Accelerator (PSA), a network of over 500 labs collaborating to
collect psychological data from large-scale international samples of
people, is currently accepting study proposals from all areas of
psychological science. Anyone can submit a proposal, regardless of PSA
membership status, research area, methodology, or career stage. We
especially encourage submissions in research areas including but not
limited to clinical psychology, community psychology, developmental
psychology, and neuroscience. The deadline for submission is September
15th, 2019. The mission of the PSA is to accelerate the accumulation of
reliable and generalizable evidence in psychological science, reducing
the distance between the truth about human behavior and mental processes
and our current understanding. For a full overview of the PSA, please
see our paper introducing our policies and procedures
(<https://psyarxiv.com/785qu/>). For information on previous successful
submissions, please see each study's status page, with descriptions and
links to study materials and preprints
(<https://psysciacc.org/studies/>).

Proposed studies can test novel
hypotheses or focus on the replication of previous findings, can be
basic or applied in focus, and can be exploratory or confirmatory in
nature. Because accepted studies will likely involve considerable use of
resources, the study selection process begins with the evaluation of a
stage 1 [Registered Report](https://osf.io/8mpji/) style submission.
Once submitted, the proposals will be masked and checked for
completeness. Then, our Study Selection Committee will conduct an
initial evaluation of all proposed studies (see below for more
information on the feasibility check portion of this initial
evaluation), and vote on their acceptability for further consideration.
Studies that pass this check will be fully evaluated by 6-11 peer
reviewers, shared with all members of the PSA network to be rated, and
either provisionally accepted or rejected by the Study Selection
Committee. Studies that are provisionally accepted enter a second stage
of preparation and final evaluation before the PSA officially accepts
the project, makes a public announcement, and recruits data collection
labs. During this second stage of preparation and evaluation, the PSA
and proposing authors collectively conduct a needs assessment. The goal
is to identify all of the resources the provisionally-accepted project
will need in terms of methodology, funding, translation, ethics, data
monitor, project monitor, and logistics. This is an in-depth feasibility
evaluation that will ensure that the project, if officially accepted,
can be carried out to a high standard for rigor. Projects that pass the
in-depth feasibility evaluation proceed to the preparation phase. During
this phase, the PSA assigns key PSA personnel to the project, including
a project monitor, methodologist, data monitor, ethics monitor, and
translation monitor in accordance with the needs assessment (these roles
can be filled by proposing authors if they have the skills and capacity
to do so). This group will then meet with the proposing authors to 1)
establish a collaboration agreement, 2) identify who will be the lead
communicator with data collection labs, and 3) establish a clear
deadline for the proposing authors to convert their PSA proposal into a
journal-quality draft of a Stage 1 Registered Report (RR). This
journal-quality draft RR represents the final record of the motivation
for the study and the methods to be used, including analysis plan. PSA
directors will review the RR to make the final decision about whether to
officially accept the project and make a public announcement to recruit
data collection labs (with a link to the RR). Projects that are
officially accepted move to the next stage of preparation, in which
proposing authors will revise the RR based on feedback on the draft sent
out to data collection labs and obtain ethics approval at their primary
institution. Even after official acceptance, PSA studies may go through
revisions. For instance, reviewers at journals may suggest additional
measures or procedural changes. Accepted proposals are not unchangeable.
However, proposing authors and the PSA will make every effort to
minimize the likelihood of post-acceptance changes. If the changes
necessary after acceptance are too many in number or too significant,
the PSA may ask proposing authors to withdraw their project and resubmit
it during the next call for studies. Changes that are most likely to
trigger a request for resubmission are those that increase the burden on
data collecting sites. After official acceptance, all review materials
(submissions, peer reviews, network ratings, and Study Selection
Committee decision letters) will be made publicly available for accepted
submissions, but not rejected submissions.

## Feasibility

All feasibility decisions are made with respect to our current, and
ever-changing, resources. Although the PSA is comprised of hundreds of
labs from around the world who have agreed, in principle, to volunteer
some of their resources to PSA projects, we may not be able to
accommodate all types of designs. A few important feasibility
considerations that may result in a study not moving beyond the
feasibility check include:

-   Does the study require specialized equipment (e.g., eye-tracking,
    EEG) or proprietary experimental software (e.g., E-Prime) to be used
    at the data collection sites?
-   Can experimental materials and analysis scripts be shared easily and
    made publicly available?
-   Does the study require "hard-to reach" samples (e.g., children,
    minority groups, clinical populations, etc.)?
-   Is the target sample size per site, number of data collection sites,
    duration of the individual data collection sessions, and number of
    data collection sessions required fully justified and balanced so as
    to not overburden the PSA network?
-   Is the likelihood and severity of risk to participants kept to a
    minimum, such that the risk is not greater than what participants
    would face normally and would not require special consideration or
    deliberation from an ethics board?

## Characteristics of strong submissions

Beyond simply being feasible given current PSA resources, strong
submissions will also:

-   Accurately and clearly describe literature relevant to the study's
    goals and design, such that researchers unfamiliar with the subject
    can understand the basic concepts behind the theory/phenomenon and
    the purpose of the research.
-   Clearly articulate the purpose of the research, relevant research
    questions, and hypotheses (if confirmatory).
-   Clearly articulate the research design, with a focus on sound
    methodology appropriate to the research questions, including
    adequate power analysis to justify sample size.
-   Provide examples of relevant material, for example websites,
    experimental scripts (e.g., E-prime, Inquist, OpenSesame), precise
    experimental design, and/or stimuli.
-   Accurately and clearly describe an analysis strategy appropriate to
    the research questions and design. Pilot or simulated data and
    working analysis scripts are ideal for clarity.
-   Make a compelling case for the importance of large-scale
    collaborative data collection for the project.

## Submission Format and Guidelines

The following components are required for all submissions:

-   Cover Page, including the title of the study, date of the latest
    draft, and keywords
-   Abstract of up to 150 words
-   Main body submission text of up to 5,000 words
-   A version of the submission with cover page included
-   A masked version of the submission without the cover page
-   References
-   Supplementary materials

The following guidelines are intended to assist you in the preparation
of your study submission to the Psychological Science Accelerator.
Submissions normally include a description of the key background
literature and motivation for the study, hypotheses, study procedures,
proposed statistical analysis plan, a statistical power analysis, and
pilot data (wherever applicable). 

### Introduction

A review of the
relevant literature that motivates the research question and a full
description of the study aims and hypotheses. 

### Method

A full description of proposed sample characteristics, including criteria for
data inclusion and exclusion (e.g., outlier extraction). Procedures for
objectively defining exclusion criteria caused by technical errors or
for any other reasons must be specified, including details of how and
under what conditions data would be replaced. A description of study
procedures in sufficient detail to allow another researcher to repeat
the methodology exactly, without requiring further information. Proposed
analysis pipeline, including all preprocessing steps, and a precise
description of all planned analyses, including appropriate correction
for multiple comparisons. Specify all covariates or regressors. Specify
analysis decisions that are contingent on the outcome of prior analyses.


### Results

Studies involving Neyman-Pearson inference must include a
statistical power analysis. Estimated effect sizes should be justified
with reference to the existing literature or theory. Because publication
bias inflates published estimates of effect size, power analysis should
be based on the lowest available or meaningful estimate of the effect
size. In the case of highly uncertain effect sizes, a variable sample
size and interim data analysis is permissible but with inspection points
stated in advance, [appropriate Type I error correction for 'peeking'
employed](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2023),
and a final stopping rule for data collection outlined. For studies
involving analyses with Bayes factors, the predictions of the theory
must be specified so that a Bayes factor can be calculated. Authors
should indicate what distribution will be used to represent the
predictions of the theory and how its parameters will be specified. Full
descriptions must be provided of any outcome-neutral criteria that must
be met for successful testing of the stated hypotheses. Such quality
checks might include the absence of floor or ceiling effects in data
distributions, positive controls, or other quality checks that are
orthogonal to the experimental hypotheses. 

### Supplemental Materials

Include full questionnaires, stimuli, and materials needed to conduct
the study. Pilot data can be included to establish proof of concept,
effect size estimations, or feasibility of proposed methods. Simulated
data and analysis scripts are ideal for clarity of the exclusion
criteria and analysis plan.
