## WHAT'S NEW IN BIG TEAM SCIENCE

*Call for Collaborators in Hong Kong: A Global Research Project on the "Dark Side" of Career Calling*

What if being ‚Äúcalled‚Äù to your work actually harms you? This project investigates the boundary
conditions under which career calling becomes harmful rather than beneficial for individuals. This study will involve a culturally diverse sample of workers from 11 countries: Austria, Brazil, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, and Sweden. The research team is specifically seeking collaborators who can translate the survey from *English to Traditional Chinese* and collect data from adult workers in *Hong Kong*.
Research teams or individuals interested in joining the global collaboration can read more details and complete a brief onboarding survey here: [https://forms.gle/KqYTZLEW7bvvFyLM6]( https://forms.gle/KqYTZLEW7bvvFyLM6 ) (*Deadline: July 18th*). You can contact the [project coordinator](ryunosuke.takagi@phd.unipd.it) for more information about the project.
