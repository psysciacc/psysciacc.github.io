### Elections

The Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA) is accepting
self-nominations for Assistant Directors of our Project Monitoring, Data
& Methods, Study Selection, and Funding Committees! Assistant Directors
directly shape the direction of the PSA any many ways, including (a)
helping establish committee-specific vision plans to help the PSA
achieve its mission and adhere to its core principles, (b) overseeing
day-to-day committee-specific operations, and (c) providing regular
updates to the PSA Director and Associate Directors about progress and
problems. They are elected by majority vote by the PSA Board of
Directors and serve 3 year terms. All who are interested are encouraged
to apply here: https://forms.gle/ZNyhZCz4GenazbYG6
