This month, we have updates on myriad fronts, including but not limited
to, a spike in new PSA membership sign-ups, progress on studies PSA 001
through PSA 006, information about our recently launched PSA Covid Rapid
Studies, a call for new members on two PSA working groups, and several
interesting opportunities to collaborate with other PSA members on
research projects.

**MEMBERSHIP**

Our network has officially grown to over 1, 000 members. Welcome new
accelerators!! We have no doubts that you will do great things in our
network. Just in the last couple months since our last newsletter, we
have added hundreds of members. We are stoked to see our network
continue to grow.

**STUDY UPDATES**

-   PSA 001- The Stage 2 Registered Report received a
    revise-and-resubmit from *Nature Human Behaviour*. The lead authors
    have made the requested changes, and the participating labs are
    currently reviewing the updated manuscript. After the lead authors
    address those comments, they will resubmit the
    [manuscript.](https://psyarxiv.com/n26dy){rel="noreferrer noopener"
    target="_blank"}
-   PSA 002/003- As a result of the pandemic, face-to-face data
    collection for the 002/003 bundle has been suspended until further
    notice. We are currently testing the feasibility of moving the
    procedure online, in case there are no opportunities for in-person
    data collection for the remainder of the year. Our goal is to
    complete data collection and submit [002's Stage 2 registered
    report](https://psyarxiv.com/t2pjv/){rel="noreferrer noopener"
    target="_blank"} by the end of 2020. Thus far, we have collected
    data from 2,560 participants across 16 languages!
-   PSA 004- The Accelerated CREP originally should have been ending
    data collection right about now, but has been extended through the
    end of 2020 because of Coronavirus-related delays. You can still
    join the project to collect data (onboarding
    form [here](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fforms%2Fd%2Fe%2F1FAIpQLSdUif1jYxmf_Mr6svuPm3oqBC7vm3EjbiBdewiqNgzU-Iz7ng%2Fviewform){rel="noreferrer noopener"
    target="_blank"})! All data collection can happen online.
-   PSA 005- The lead team is working on finishing up its revisions of
    the Stage 1 [Registered
    Report](https://psyarxiv.com/6hju9){rel="noreferrer noopener"
    target="_blank"}. Our editor at *Nature Human Behaviour* asked us to
    do some pilot testing of our technical implementation of the
    adaptive algorithm that governs condition assignment. With Erin
    Buchanan\'s help, we implemented all aspects of the project in formr
    and conducted a variety of tests to ensure that the condition
    assignment changes as appropriate in light of different kinds of
    evidence. This whole effort went slower than expected due to the
    outbreak of the coronavirus, but we received an extension from our
    editor. We\'ve also finished a first draft of our paper revisions
    and our response to reviewers. We expect to submit the revision
    within 1-2 weeks.
-   PSA 006- The PSA 006 project is currently collecting data. So far,
    the \~150 participating labs have collected data from 8,450
    participants. Following the [registered
    plan](https://psyarxiv.com/9uaqm/), the team is conducting
    sequential data analyses in three cultural clusters. Further rounds
    of data collection are expected later this year.
-   PSACR 1/2/3- PSA Covid Rapid (PSACR) is three bundled studies
    running together along with some general questions. PSACR 001 and
    003 will be submitted for publication after data collection is
    complete. PSACR 002 was accepted as a Stage 1 Registered Report at
    *Nature Human Behavior*. Data collection is live for all three
    studies in English, Hungarian, and Dutch and many more languages are
    in the translation and implementation pipeline. Over 5,000 people
    have participated so far. Many people have been working hard to pull
    off this project and in particular, Heather Urry, Max Primbs, and
    Erin Buchanan have done tremendous work to keep the project afloat,
    catch errors, and help move translation and implementation along.
-   Upcoming New Studies- Resulting  from our 2019 call for studies, 1
    proposal has been accepted pending minor revisions, two are being
    revised and resubmitted with possible acceptance in 2020, and
    several more are being revised and resubmitted in preparation for
    future calls for studies.

**PSA SERVER** **PURCHASED**

Thanks to a generous donation from Erin Buchanan, we were able to
purchase new server equipment to support the increasing complexity and
data collection load of our current and future PSA studies! The new
server has been blazing fast in our initial tests, and it should be
ready for us to start using in earnest soon. This also means we are
going to be able to overhaul our  member website to give it a
functioning dashboard that will be more effective and user-friendly for
members.

**PLANNING THE PSA\'S FIRST CONFERENCE**

We are hoping to host a virtual meeting in 2020 and are exploring
possible dates. Our preliminary plan is to hold the conference in
September (on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, or on 8th, 9th, and 10th) with
sessions spreading across 12 hour each days to help accommodate the vast
time zone differences of PSA members. We are hoping to get feedback on
which set of days works best for our members (starting on the 1st of
September or starting on the 8th of September). We are planning to have
a range of session types, including update presentations on current PSA
studies, workshops on how to get involved in our studies, study
submission tips, as well as presentations on non-PSA research that our
members are currently working on. We hope to have further details for
y\'all soon. Please reach out to <slewis16@ashland.edu> to give feedback
on preferred dates or if you would like to be added to our email list of
possible attendees.

**DATA AND METHODS COMMITTEE SEEKS NEW MEMBERS**

The PSA Data and Methods Committee is seeking a new standing member of
our committee. The Data and Methods Committee (DM) is responsible for
operation and policy development related to methodology, meta-science,

****P**SA METASCIENCE SUBCOMMITTEE SEEKS NEW MEMBERS**

The PSA Metascience subcommittee is looking for up to 5 new members to
help facilitate Metascience research projects within the PSA.  The role
of the subcommittee will be to review proposals on work that uses the
PSA to research the process of science, as well as develop policy to
support metascience research. Responsibilities of subcommittee members
will include reviewing proposals, interfacing with members of the Study
Selection, Data and Methods, and Data Management Committees when
appropriate, and meeting monthly as a group to review progress.

**If you're interested, send your information to Nick Fox:
nfox423@gmail.com by Friday May 29th.**  Include a short paragraph on
why you'd like to join the subcommittee, what you're looking to get out
of being a subcommittee member, and any metascience or methodological
research experience you've had (it's not required, but will be helpful

**OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO COLLABORATE WITH PSA MEMBERS**

**African Many Labs**

-   We are starting the ManyLabs: Africa project, which is a doctoral
    thesis on the replicability and generalizability of effects across
    African and Western populations. The project is led by Adeyemi
    Adetula, currently at Université Grenoble Alpes (France). The
    project is supervised by Drs. [Hans IJzerman](https://corelab.io/),
    [Dana Basnight-
    Brown](https://www.usiu.ac.ke/423/brown-dana-basnight-phd/?schl=school-of-humanities-social-sciences)
    and [Patrick Forscher](https://corelab.io/). 

    We call for researchers from Africa to serve as collaborators in a
    pilot study (using the CREP framework for a one-study project) and
    researchers from Africa, Europe, and North America for the main
    study (ManyLabs: Africa). As part of this project, we will provide
    online training / webinar courses on open science access and tools
    to African researchers. 

    Collaborators can earn authorship for data collection, translation,
    and coordination of their research unit. Other activities could
    include consultation on study/effects nomination and evaluation.

-   **Research on how you cope with home-office**

Our team would like to explore how researchers cope with working from
home now and in general. This is a great opportunity for the research
community to change old routines and optimize the time they spend in the
office and work from home.

From our survey results, we will create recommendations for institutions
on how to support researchers\' efficiency and work-life balance
regarding their options and condition in remote working. After
responding, you can sign up to win a **100 USD** Amazon (or your choice)
voucher. If your region was in recent lockdown, please share your
experience with home-office in this **\~4-min** anonymous survey.
