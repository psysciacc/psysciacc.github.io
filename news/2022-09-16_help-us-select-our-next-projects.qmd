Project proposal submissions to the PSA's [special call for
studies](https://psysciacc.org/2022/07/28/special-call-for-studies-studying-generalizability-with-global-samples-deadline-extended/)
that have passed the initial phase of study selection are now available
for network evaluations. PSA members can read and provide feedback on
the proposals in a [survey on the Canvas membership
site](https://canvas.psysciacc.org/courses/1/quizzes/89). Specifically,
you will be asked to rate the submission as a potential PSA project and
indicate your interest in contribution to the project if selected.
Providing feedback is completely optional, but much appreciated, and
will not take much of your time. The deadline to submit evaluations is
September 30th.
