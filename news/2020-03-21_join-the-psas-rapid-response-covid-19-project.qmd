The world is currently witnessing a public health crisis that is
unprecedented in our lifetimes: the global COVID-19 pandemic. At the
Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA), we are deeply concerned about
the many impacts of this outbreak, but we are also optimistic about
behavioral science's potential to mitigate these impacts. With our
network of more than 500 labs from over 70 countries, we believe that --
with your help -- the PSA can play a crucial role in this process. This
can only occur if our member labs, and new labs who would like to join
us, contribute to project administration and local data collection. Last
week, we put out [a
call](https://psysciacc.org/news/2020-03-13_the-psa-calls-for-rapid-and-impactful-study-proposals-on-covid-19.html)
for rapid and impactful studies to understand the behavioral and
psychological aspects of the COVID-19 outbreak. We received an
overwhelming response. The community submitted a whopping 66 (!!)
proposals. 141 PSA members voted on the 11 proposals that passed triage.
Yesterday, we provisionally accepted the three proposals that received
the most votes, with another four proposals on our "waitlist."
Waitlisted studies will come off the waitlist if we receive an
overwhelming response during lab recruitment and if early preparation
for our first three studies goes smoothly. We anticipate that all PSA
COVID-Rapid studies will be bundled into a single data collection
effort. You can read more details about the selected studies and the
process of contributing to data collection
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1IlM4NvrSPNVArMNCCD2VJFpBiPpzoghxrge8iHun_kw/edit#).
**We need your help.** This project is big. We aim to recruit thousands
of participants from all over the globe. We can only succeed with this
aim through the collective energy of our members. **You can contribute
your time and expertise.** One way to help is by joining the COVID-Rapid
project. After joining, you can volunteer to manage the projects,
translate the project materials into one of over 50 languages, or help
with data collection by recruiting online participants from your local
community. If you have questions about the process of joining the study,
contact the PSA COVID-19 Gmail account at <psacovid@gmail.com>. To join
this project:

1.  Become a member of the PSA by registering at the [member
    website](https://member.psysciacc.org)
2.  Log in to the [member website](https://member.psysciacc.org)
3.  Click on My Lab \> Study Sign Up
4.  Complete your member profile at My Account \> Create Profile

If you wish to recruit participants for the project, you must be willing
to do so *fast*. This will require very fast ethics approval and data
collection. We anticipate that most sites will either join an existing
IRB application as an investigator (e.g., the application at Chris
Chartier's Ashland University), ask their local IRBs to defer to an IRB
that has granted us approval, obtain an ethics waiver because the study
is minimal risk, or go through expedited review. We will work with you
on the ethics process once you join the project. **You can also
contribute financially.** To pull off a project of this magnitude, we
also need financial contributions. For those who can, you can donate via
[PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?token=bZ78t4mUg7XlbPPdAJmzQ645Ti_4TkgU2MZx4QXwiO71MnVSCDG6jgjYdOzWHvAkUbobA0&country.x=US&locale.x=US).
Every dollar received will be spent [supporting this
project](https://psysciacc.org/news/2020-03-18_support-the-psa-covid-19-rapid-and-impactful-studies-with-a-donation.html).
Financial contributions will be used to pay participants, aid with
recruitment, compensate translators, and compensate other administrative
contributors. The PSA has an opportunity to activate our global network
to confront the global challenge of COVID-19. We will only succeed with
your support and involvement. Together, we can harness the potential of
behavioral science to further the public good.
