Hello all you amazingly talented and dedicated Accelerators! We've made
some really tremendous progress in June, and this newsletter will
provide updates on PSA personnel, the upcoming PSA conference, all of
our current studies and more.

## Research Coordinator

Thanks to seed funding from Ashland University and some personal
donations from PSA leadership, the PSA has hired [Savannah
Lewis](https://twitter.com/Savvylewis15) to serve as Research
Coordinator. She will help to organize our conference (see below),
provide administrative support for all of our studies, and fundraise to
better support our members. Some of you have already worked with
Savannah on Slack or Zoom and can attest to how lucky we are to have her
working on the PSA (Chris speaking here :)! Shoot her a Slack DM to
welcome her and connect on any initiatives or projects you'd like help
with.

## Translation Capacity Assessment

The Translation and Cultural Diversity Committee (TCDC) wants to assess
the translation capacity of the PSA: across many possible languages of
translation, how many potential translators do we have? This knowledge
will help us to determine our potential availability and scarcity in
languages, and thus make better plans in future projects. Please answer
this very short, [1-minute
survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfkWhCPl_Zj1o4EhW3jdwGRLo0Wd9h4aMOW9wXk9wt9CLpYiw/viewform),
to help us.

## Conference

We are now in the process of lining up specific sessions, moderators,
and presenters for the conference. As of right now we have 120 confirmed
attendees (with a cap of 300)! This means we still have spots open if
you have not yet registered, [which you can do
here](https://psysciacc.org/the-2020-virtual-meeting-of-the-psychological-science-accelerator/).
We have also started distributing receipts to all registered attendees
who were able to pay the \$60 fee (thank you, your payment also created
2 free spots for others at the conference). Please be on the lookout for
those receipts in your inbox, and let us know if you need any additional
documentation to facilitate reimbursement from your institution.

## SIPS

Several members gave a really nice presentation about the PSA as an
"unconference" session at SIPS. Thanks to Erin Buchanan, Jordan Wagge,
Max Primbs, Crystal N. Steltenpohl, and Jeremy Miller for representing
us there. The session was recorded, so we also now have an overview
[video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE8dvPMutvo#action=share)
that we can share with folks who are curious about the PSA. Feel free to
pass it along to colleagues!

## Current Studies

-   **PSA 001-** The Stage 2 Registered Report has been resubmitted to
    *Nature Human Behaviour*. Now we are waiting for the final decision
    from the editor.
-   **PSA 002/003-** Thanks to the amazing collaboration between Merle
    Shuckart, Alessandra Souza, and Erin Buchanan we have been able to
    start getting this study bundle online. If your lab is going to be
    running the study online, each lab will need to provide an
    information text to participants signing up explaining the goals,
    risk, etc.
-   **PSA 004-** Data collection has slowed down as many members\'
    universities have concluded their semesters. We do however need more
    CREP reviewers as we wrap up this project at the end of the year.
    CREP reviewers look over each lab\'s OSF page to ensure that each
    lab is performing the study as planned. If you or someone else is
    interested please have them fill out this
    [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdB7BDtPSI6q_7UxeUcqy4EKNxtYazZwR7P9SVbVKmd6rFBlg/viewform).
-   **PSA 005-** The PSA005 team completed its feasibility pilot of the
    technical implementation of the study. The leadership team then
    finished its revision to the manuscript and resubmitted this
    revision to *Nature Human Behaviour!* COVID-19 has disrupted the
    data collection timeline, but the leadership has decided to monitor
    the situation at the start of each semester to determine the safety
    and feasibility of in-person data collection.
-   **PSA 006-** The PSA 006 project is currently collecting data. So
    far, the \~150 participating labs have collected data over 8, 000
    participants. Following the registered plan, the team is conducting
    sequential data analyses in three cultural clusters. Further rounds
    of data collection are expected later this year.
-   **PSACR 001/002/003-** The PSACR bundle is collecting data in 19
    languages, and the data collection deadline has been extended
    through mid-July or longer (we will continue collecting data as long
    as we can afford to). We are collecting data through PSA member labs
    and also through several panels. Over 10,000 people have
    participated so far, meaning that they completed the general
    questions about the pandemic and one or more of the study surveys.

Thank you for all that you have, and continue to do, on behalf of the
PSA. Let's keep accelerating psychological science together!

**-Chris and Savannah**
