In 2017, Chris Chartier shared a [blog
post](https://christopherchartier.com/2017/08/26/building-a-cern-for-psychological-science/)
that revealed a grand vision for psychology research: psychologists
could build a "CERN for psychology" that does for psychology what
particle accelerators have done for physics. This "CERN for psychology"
would be an organization that harnessed, organized, and coordinated the
joint efforts of psychology labs throughout the world to take on large,
nationally diverse big team science projects.

The months after Chris's blog went live revealed that enough people
believed in this vision to start building this "CERN for psychology".
These early efforts would evolve into the Psychological Science
Accelerator, a network that, according to our recent [study capacity
report](https://psyarxiv.com/v9zma), now spans 1400 members from 71
countries. In these early months, the PSA also collaboratively developed
a set of [five guiding
principles](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2515245918797607),
namely *diversity and inclusion, decentralized authority, transparency,
rigor, and openness to criticism*, that form a coherent vision for the
type of science we want psychology to be. We want to help transform
psychology to become more rigorous, transparent, collaborative, and more
representative of humanity writ large.

Now, three years after its founding, the PSA stands at a crossroads.
This crossroads relates to our broad vision of what the PSA is and
should be and the means through which we achieve that broad vision. This
post will cover the first issue. As we will describe, we believe our
early documents point to a vision of the PSA as active, rather than
passive, but that a lack of funding streams constrains our ability to
achieve that mission.

**Minimal and maximal visions of the PSA**

Although the PSA was established to coordinate the activities of
research labs, there are a wide range of options as to how this
coordination is implemented. The specific implementations anchor two
radically different visions of the PSA: a *minimal* vision and a
*maximal* vision.

Imagine a PSA that is radically different from the one we have now: the
PSA as a **mailing list**. 

This mailing list contains the contact information of people who are
willing, in principle, to participate in team science projects. To use
the mailing list, people design a team science study and email a
description of the study to the list. People who receive a study
invitation through the mailing list and freely reply to the study
proposer. The mailing list itself is unregulated, so there is no vetting
process for any of the emails people send over it, nor is there any
support for the people who send invitations through the mailing list.
This vision of the PSA is highly minimal in the sense that the PSA plays
very little role in coordinating or implementing team science projects.
However, this vision is also very low cost, as mailing lists are cheap
to set up and almost free to maintain. In a sense, this minimalist
version of the PSA already exists in the form of
[StudySwap](https://osf.io/meetings/studyswap/) \-- a useful tool, but
not a transformative one.

Now imagine a PSA that is a bit more similar to the one we have now: the
PSA as an **active implementer of big team science projects**.

In this vision, the PSA completes all stages of the team science
research process. This means that the PSA takes partial ownership over
its projects and participates in project decisions. This includes
selecting projects to undertake through a rigorous review process,
assisting with the theoretical development of studies, and improving on
the design of studies by soliciting multiple rounds of feedback from
relevant experts. In this vision, the PSA also actively coordinates and
manages study teams to ensure that relevant administrative procedures
(such as ethics review) are followed and to ensure that the various
stages of the project occur on a reasonable schedule. The PSA also takes
an active role in communicating completed projects to the world, perhaps
by managing its own journal (the *Proceedings of the Psychological
Science Accelerator*) and through its own dedicated press team. Finally,
in this vision, the PSA has a variety of procedures to proactively
improve its processes, including novel methods research, team science
best practice research, project retrospectives, and exit interviews of
PSA staffers who decide to leave the organization. This is the deluxe
vision of the PSA, a PSA that is active but that requires lots of money
and staff to maintain.

These two visions of the PSA \-- the minimal and maximal \-- also anchor
an entire universe of in-between visions that are not so extreme.
However, what is arguably true is that the vision of the PSA laid out in
Chris's blog post, as well as the one implied the PSA's five guiding
principles, *are both much closer to the maximal vision of the PSA than
the minimal one*.

**Money is necessary to implement a maximal vision of the PSA**

If we accept that fulfilling the PSA's mission requires something closer
to a maximal vision of the PSA, we need to find ways to build the PSA
into this more maximal vision. At a minimum, building and maintaining a
maximal vision of the PSA requires **people** who can do the activities
involved in this maximal vision. These people need to be recruited,
managed, and retained, otherwise they will work at cross purposes, get
into interpersonal conflicts, and burn out. In short, in addition to the
people who carry out the PSA's vision, the PSA needs an administrative
structure to help these people carry out their work.

The PSA does, in fact, have a defined administrative structure. We have,
for example, defined [a set of
committees](https://psysciacc.org/about/people/) to govern its
activities and a set of
[roles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CLwqWxOvuUL2RYv0jz2Hi8kIgx58fo2icirrBTRzBgo/edit#heading=h.f45wujqst5em)
that should be filled for each project. These roles outline an
aspiration for the PSA to proactively conduct team science research \--
further suggesting that the PSA has a maximalist vision for itself.

These roles are many. Our [recent
evaluation](https://psyarxiv.com/v9zma) of the PSA's administrative
capacity identifies fully 115 of them. If we assume that each position
requires 5 hours per week of work to complete the associated
responsibilities, the 115 roles require 29,900 hours per year to staff.
Unfortunately, maintaining this level of labor has, at times, been
challenging because of our reliance on volunteers who have other daily
commitments (such as jobs that pay them).

We can rely on volunteers to carry this load for a time, but doing so
carries some real risks. For example, the heavy load can risk burning
out the most active volunteers who take on the most labor and lead to
large, costly mistakes if the labor requirements for large projects are
not met. This load can also provoke interpersonal conflict if active
volunteers feel that their labor is not properly recognized or credited.
Finally, there are risks associated with *who is able* to be a
volunteer: in a volunteer model, only those who can afford to will
donate their time and efforts to the PSA. This squeezes out the voices
and talents of some of the very people the PSA wants to elevate, such as
those from Africa, Middle America, and South America. **Our**
[**2020-2021 study capacity report**](https://psyarxiv.com/v9zma)
**estimates that 90% of all people involved in administrative roles are
from North America and Western Europe**. The majority of these, 63% of
all administrative roles, are located in North America.

Other growing organizations have managed the transition from an
exclusively volunteer organization to one that is funded by some sort of
income stream. We can learn from [their
history](https://kula.uvic.ca/articles/10.5334/kula.7/), which shows
that the organizations that became sustainable did so by leveraging
their already-existing strengths.

The first step down the path of creating a sustainably funded
organization involves acknowledging that many of the positions outlined
in PSA policies are best served, not as volunteer positions, but as paid
positions. We must also acknowledge that the costs of paying for this
labor may be high. If we assume that all 29,900 hours are paid, and paid
at even a very low wage (\$7.25/hour, or US minimum wage), we still get
a labor cost of at least \$216,775 per year. This does not consider
taxes, vacation, or other overhead. 

Of course, it may not be necessary to pay for all 29,900 hours, either
because our staffing estimates are inaccurate, or because our labor
becomes more efficient when we switch to a paid model. Yet the mere act
of thinking through these considerations requires recognizing that the
PSA's maximalist vision has a financial cost.

**What we can be is constrained by our ability to obtain resources**

The vision of the PSA outlined in its founding documents is grand. If
implemented successfully, this vision could have an impact on psychology
that is transformative, creating a science that is more inclusive, more
collaborative, more transparent, and more robust.

Yet the PSA cannot realize this vision of itself for free. Currently,
the PSA attempts to be a maximalist institution on a minimalist budget.
That has worked during the PSA's early years, but such a model may not
be sustainable long-term. If we wish to implement a maximal vision for
the PSA, we will need to focus dedicated energy into obtaining the
funding needed for this implementation. As we will describe in a
follow-up post, this will likely require developing funding streams
outside of the traditional grant mechanisms to which scientists are
accustomed.
