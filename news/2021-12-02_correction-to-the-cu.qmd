Accelerators,
I apologize for the double emails today! It has come to my attention that there was an error in the newsletter sent out this afternoon. The newsletter read that "PSACR- 003 received another favorable R&R from Nature Human Behavior." When it should have read "
PSACR- 003 received another favorable R&R from PNAS." You will see this reflected on our website version (https://psysciacc.org/news/2021-11-30_3230.html) of the newsletter. Thank you!
