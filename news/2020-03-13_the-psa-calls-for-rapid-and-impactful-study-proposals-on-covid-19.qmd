## Purpose of this call

The [Psychological Science Accelerator](https://psysciacc.org/) (PSA) is
the largest consortium of research psychologists in the world.
Behavioral scientists can play an important role in combating the
growing COVID-19 pandemic if we quickly take action to collect
high-quality data from large, global samples. The PSA wants to team up
with researchers working on important questions related to this
pandemic.

## Scope of study proposals

We are soliciting proposals for studies that can be conducted online.
Studies should be relatively easy to conduct. We are only interested in
applied, not basic, research. Research proposals from multi-disciplinary
teams (e.g., health researchers, psychologists, and data scientists)
will be prioritized. Proposals should not exceed 1 page. This one page
should include the basic research question, (very briefly) the relevant
literature, identify whether the research is exploratory or
confirmatory, and how the research will contribute to reducing the
effects of the current crisis. If confirmatory, the researchers should
clearly identify the hypothesis/hypotheses and the needed sample size
for answering their research question. If exploratory, the researchers
should identify how data will be used to generate hypotheses. In
addition, if exploratory, the researchers will have to identify how they
will use methods including - but not limited to - cross-validation for
greater certainty about the generated ideas. If feasible and volunteers
are available, the network may be able to assist with translation into
the major world languages. However, if you need your study conducted in
multiple languages, we encourage you to have a translation plan in
place.

## What we're offering

We are offering to share study proposals to the PSA network in order to
connect interested and available collaborators to high-quality projects
concerning COVID-19. The PSA currently comprises [over 700 researchers
from labs in over 70
countries](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/1103427/).
[Gorilla](https://gorilla.sc/){target="_blank"} has also offered free
use of their online experiment builder if it could be helpful for these
project.

## What we're not offering

Because this call for proposals is truly exceptional and is not going
through the normal PSA study pipeline, we cannot guarantee the same
levels of support standard PSA studies receive. In particular, we cannot
guarantee a minimum number of collaborators or data collection labs, nor
can we guarantee official support through our committee structure.
Nevertheless, we will share the selected studies with our network, and
we strongly suspect that PSA members may volunteer their time and
expertise to help with aspects of your study (e.g., data management,
analysis support).

## The selection process

Proposals will be evaluated on a rolling basis, but should be submitted
before Tuesday March 17, 2020, 5pm EST. Proposals will be initially
screened by the Director and Associate Directors for feasibility and fit
with the scope of this call. Studies that meet that threshold will be
put to a rapid up-or-down vote (within 24 hours) from the entire
network. All proposals that receive more upvotes than downvotes will be
released to the network to pair collaborators with selected studies. At
that point, any interested and capable PSA member that would like to
join a project will be encouraged to do so.

## Outlets

One of the potential outlets to publish for this call is Nature Human
Behaviour, which has [committed to efficient
turnaround](https://twitter.com/NatureHumBehav/status/1238148310227181576){target="_blank"}
regarding papers concerning this crisis. Royal Society Open Science has
also announced a [rapid evaluation
track](http://neurochambers.blogspot.com/2020/03/calling-all-scientists-rapid-evaluation.html){target="_blank"}
for Registered Reports related to COVID-19. Researchers relying on our
infrastructure will be required to post their work on a preprint server
(like PsyArxiv) for quick dissemination.

## How to submit

Send your proposals to Hans IJzerman (<h.ijzerman@gmail.com>), Charlie
Ebersole (<cebersole@virginia.edu>), and our general PSA email address
(<psysciaccelerator@gmail.com>). Please reach out to us if you have any
questions about this call for proposals. These are frightening and
uncertain times, but psychological scientists are well-positioned to
conduct high-quality research into this growing pandemic, and our work
can help indicate how the global community can best respond to it. We
look forward to reading your ideas!
