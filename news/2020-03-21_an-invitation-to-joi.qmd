Accelerators,

I hope you are doing as well as is possible given the circumstances.

We have made considerable progress on the PSA COVID RAPID project in the last week. We have now made some study selection decisions, and welcome you to join the project if you are interested in contributing. You can read much more about it, and sign-up to join, in this blogpost (https://psysciacc.org/news/2020-03-21_join-the-psas-rapid-response-covid-19-project.html) .

Fingers crossed that you are all staying safe and healthy! Please reach out with any questions or requests you have of me.
