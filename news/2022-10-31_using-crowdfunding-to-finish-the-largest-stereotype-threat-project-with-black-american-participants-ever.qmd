In 2018, the Psychological Science Accelerator
[selected](https://psysciacc.org/2018/10/19/a-large-scale-multi-site-examination-of-stereotype-threat-across-varying-operationalizations-a-newly-selected-accelerator-study/)
an unusual study to conduct. Instead of using the PSA network to achieve
an international sample, this study focused on a hard-to-reach study
population: Black American college students. Compared to previous
studies, the project was also unusually applied-facing, as it focused on
a theory that was developed to understand, and hopefully address,
performance gaps in settings like college where strong performance could
affect a person's life trajectory.

The proposed project aimed to address potential weaknesses in the
evidence for the theory while simultaneously demonstrating how we can
use big team science to achieve the sample sizes needed for informative
quantitative tests of theories about hard-to-reach populations. The
budding PSA network saw merit in this project, and at least one journal
has agreed, as the project was accepted in principle as a Registered
Report at [*Nature Human
Behaviour*](https://springernature.figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Stereotype_Threat_in_Black_College_Students_Across_Many_Operationalizations_Registered_Report_Stage_1_Protocol_/13122617)*.*

Four years later and data collection is going strong. As of October 31,
2022, we have recruited 1025 Black college students into our project.
This is a stunning accomplishment, and already puts our project among
the largest ever studies of stereotype threat among Black American
college students. This accomplishment has only been possible due to
financial contributions from the project leadership team, which we have
redistributed to data collection labs to defray the costs of participant
recruitment.

However, 1025 is still short of our goal of a minimum of 2000
participants. We now believe we need **crowdfunding** to reach our data
collection goal.

You can donate to this project
[here](https://opencollective.com/psysciacc/projects/psa-005/donate).
Any donations we receive that exceed our financial need will be donated
to the PSA at project's end, as we have relied heavily on PSA resources
to make this project happen.

Help us finish an amazing -- and, for psychology, historic -- project,
further demonstrating the potential of [big team
science](https://psyarxiv.com/2mdxh/) for solving some of behavioral
science's most pressing problems.\
