## New PSA Studies in Progress!!

Weâ€™re excited to announce that the following studies are now entering the next phase in the PSAâ€™s study pipeline:

-   [Global Crises](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J5gp5s7xiDj6uLGch4E4n3Mqyi-voPmy/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103542693559626876995&rtpof=true&sd=true)

-   [Emotion Differentiation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XfVPxElTtVSmB3i3AVaPMeZmlJtJ8y4s/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103542693559626876995&rtpof=true&sd=true)

-   [AWE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kjcZB23CSLv83juGdiXQnES6BvJloxlQ/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103542693559626876995&rtpof=true&sd=true)

-   [Social Evaluation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LXkRYa8AkcMA-D396oWn3lvZdJUMoimf/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=103542693559626876995&rtpof=true&sd=true)

Now the proposing authors have **six months** to complete their revisions and submit the study for final approval. They will then enter into a collaborative planning process with the directors to identifies the logistical, methodological, and recruitment needs of their study needs from our network before starting recruitment. This process is called the PSA Needs Assessment phase and ensures that each project is ready to succeed as a global collaboration by matching them with the right resources and support.

Stay tuned for updates on these exciting new studies! ðŸš€
