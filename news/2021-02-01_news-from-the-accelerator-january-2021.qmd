The first month of 2021 is over and we have had quite a month! We kicked
off 2021 with our first published study and we enter into some new and
exciting transitions ahead of us. We look forward to seeing what else
this year will bring.

#### Study updates:

-   **PSA 001-** This project is now officially
    [online](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01007-2) at
    Nature Human Behaviour! This puts a bow on the PSA's first empirical
    project. Congratulations to the whole study team for this enormous
    accomplishment. You can read some reflections from the leadership
    team of the project on the [Nature
    blog](https://socialsciences.nature.com/posts/promises-and-challenges-of-big-team-psychology). 
-   **PSA 002/003-** The leadership team for the 002/003 bundle of
    studies has been hard at work, creating an online version of the 002
    study protocol that will not rely on in-person data collection. This
    new protocol was recently approved by the editors of the Psychonomic
    Bulletin and Review. We are now testing the 002 online link. 
-   **PSA 004-** 004 is wrapping up data collection at a few sites but
    are no longer taking any new labs. We\'ll be reaching out to
    contributors in February or March.
-   **PSA 005-** We're waiting on vaccine distribution to get to a place
    that allows in-person data collection again. This summer, we'll
    evaluate whether in-person data collection is likely to be feasible
    in fall 2021.
-   **PSA 006-** Final analyses are being completed and the manuscript
    is being written.
-   **PSA 007-** We are putting together the website for people to get
    started on this project. As soon as that is finished we will send
    out the onboarding email. If you would like to be a part of the
    pre-projects, please email [Erin Buchanan](buchananlab@gmail.com)!
-   **PSACR Bundle-** The submitting author teams are hard at work
    analyzing data and writing their manuscript drafts! Meanwhile, we
    (the admin team) are developing a data management plan (figuring out
    exactly how and when we will share the data). We also, on an ongoing
    basis, are working to make sure that everyone's contributions are
    accurately documented.

#### **Chris Farewell:**

This past month we received news that Chris Chartier has resigned from
his role as PSA Director. Chris guided the PSA from an idea to a vibrant
organization with more than 1400 members. Although he will no longer be
the PSA's director, he may yet transition into a different PSA role. In
the meantime, Charlie Ebersole will serve as acting Director of the PSA
and we will begin the process of holding an election for a new
Director. 

Below you will find Chris's farewell message to the PSA. 

"I can't wait to watch, and support, the PSA through this transition and
into the next chapter of it's growth. I\'m a bit sad to step away from
this role, because it has been such a personal joy to serve in this way,
but I\'m also very excited to see all the amazing things the PSA will
accomplish with a new Director who can give the organization the energy,
attention, and care it deserves. 

I\'ve enjoyed working with each and every one of you immensely. Thank
you from the bottom of my heart for making these last 3 and a half years
of my life so special and meaningful. It\'s a period of my life that I
will always cherish and look back on fondly. I won\'t be disappearing
from the PSA of course, but I\'m not yet sure what my next role/type of
contribution will be.

As for the practical matters of this transition, [Charlie
Ebersole](https://psych-sci-accelerator.slack.com/team/U7DD99J4D) will
serve as Interim Director until the Associate Directors group can
complete an election process for the new Director (thank you,
Charlie!!).

Onward!"

#### **Appointments and Elections:**

The PSA will be replacing several of its leadership positions in the
coming months.  Below is a quick rundown of each.

##### **Assistant Directors**

The Assistant Director positions are replaced by appointment of the
Associate Directors. We have openings for positions in the following six
committees:

-   Funding
-   Ethics
-   Community Building and Network Expansion
-   Data and Methods
-   Training
-   Translation and Cultural Diversity

After January 30th, the Acting Director and the Associate Directors will
select the new Assistant Directors from among the nominees.. If you have
any questions about this application or this process, contact the Acting
Director, Charlie Ebersole, at <cebersole@virginia.edu>. .

##### **Director and Associate Director**

This Spring, the PSA will be electing a new Director and one Associate
Director. These positions will be filled by a direct election from the
PSA network. Any PSA member may run for these positions. 

Later this month, the PSA leadership will solicit nominations (self or
others) for these roles and we plan to conduct the election process over
the next two months. If you have any questions about the election
process or what's involved in the positions, contact the Acting
Director, Charlie Ebersole, at <cebersole@virginia.edu>.

#### **Reflections on funding the PSA**

Funding lead Patrick Forscher and Associate Director Hans IJzerman
published [a
blog](https://psysciacc.org/2021/01/11/how-should-we-fund-the-psa/)
reflecting on how to fund the PSA. This blog follows up on two previous
blogs, one that reflects on the [PSA's resources for running
studies](https://psysciacc.org/2020/12/04/how-many-resources-does-the-psa-possess/),
and a second that reflects on the [financial cost of the PSA's vision
for
itself](https://psysciacc.org/2020/12/11/the-financial-cost-of-the-psas-vision/).

The new blog lays out the makings of a funding strategy for the PSA. It
lays out four possible sources of future funding: grant writing,
charitable giving, fees-for-service, and membership fees, and weighs the
strengths and weaknesses of each possibility. The blog also contains two
surveys to solicit member feedback about the ideas within the blog.

This is an important post, as it concerns the future of the PSA. If you
are interested in shaping the PSA's strategy for financial
sustainability, please give it a read.
