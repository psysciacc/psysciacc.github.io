Opportunity is distributed unequally in human affairs. Science is a
human affair, so this dictum applies to science as it applies to any
other human endeavor. At the PSA we recognize this as an unfortunate
current characteristic of science, but we also think that science will
be both fairer and of higher quality if opportunity were distributed
more evenly. Working toward this aspiration is central to our [core
principles](https://psyarxiv.com/785qu/). However, we have some ways to
go to meet it: of the over 500 labs that have joined our network, only
14% were in South and Central America, 5% in Eastern Europe, 6% in the
Middle East, 4% in Asia, and 1% in Africa. Last year, we started an
initiative to move us closer to our aspiration: we issued three small
grants of \$400 to under-resourced labs PSA labs. These grants helped
these labs collect data and earn authorship on one of our studies. This
year, we are continuing this program. While the exact number of grants
we will be able to issue is uncertain, we hope to issue **six grants of
\$400 each** to PSA labs that wish to collect data for one of our
studies. These grants will be funded using money collected from our
[Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/psysciacc) if we meet our support goal
(see [this previous
post](https://psysciacc.org/2019/08/27/the-psas-patreon-sustainability-drive/)
for more details). We will select recipients based on the following two
criteria:

1.  *Demonstrated need*. We define "need" to mean that the data
    collection could not happen without the provision of the grant. As
    an additional provision, and as an attempt to improve lab
    representation from non-Western countries, at least three of the
    grants will go to labs from those regions.
2.  *Benefit to the PSA study in question*. We will prioritize labs that
    provide a unique benefit to the PSA study in which they are
    participating. For example, in a study of how a psychological
    process varies across cultures, we will prioritize labs that allow
    the recruitment of participants from a culture that is not already
    represented in the study.

Our current crop of accepted studies deal with topics ranging from
language comprehension, to stereotype threat, to moral decision-making.
Five of these six studies ([002 through
006](https://psysciacc.org/studies/)) are actively recruiting labs. We
also have an active [call for
studies](https://psysciacc.org/2019-call-for-studies/) that ends
September 15, 2019 that will give us a new wave of studies covering yet
more topics. This provides prospective labs with the opportunity to join
studies, and earn authorship on manuscripts, that match their interests.
If you are interested in applying for one of these grants, fill out this
[form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeW-qQXZSuvqLaVEwlfaEeKiE2I6cEzNkHyU-arQzVpLoo-Wg/viewform?usp=sf_link).
We hope this initiative will play a small but measurable role in
redistributing scientific opportunities in a fairer way.
