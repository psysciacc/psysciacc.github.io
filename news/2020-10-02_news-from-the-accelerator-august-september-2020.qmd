Today's newsletter is double-sized, summarizing PSA activities from both
August and September. It was a fun and busy 62 days with an election,
some exciting news on publications, our first conference, and much more
detailed below. As always, thank you for everything you do to accelerate
psychological science. Happy reading!!

## Associate Director Election Results

We had two excellent candidates in our election for an open Associate
Director position: Peter Mallik and John Protzko. Please join us in
congratulating John Protzko as our new Associate Director following an
extremely close network vote. We look forward to seeing the vision and
energy that John will bring to this new role. We also thank Peter for
running, and are thrilled to continue working closely with him in other
PSA roles!

**Get to know John Protozko:** He is a metascientist at the University
of California, Santa Barbra. He participated in PSA001 on data
collection and is the PM on PSA006. His research interest is in
causality as it applies to people and the implications for theory in
fields such as cognitive development, social perception, and
metascience. He. Loves. Food. and will travel the world for it.

## PSA 2020 Conference

The first ever PSA conference is in the books, and we had tons of fun!
Thank you so much to all of the organizers, presenters, moderators,
hackers, and attendees for making this first meeting a success. Over the
span of three days, multiple people presented studies and research on a
wide variety of content, and others tuned in to listen to these talks
from all over the world. If you weren\'t able to make it this year, or
had to miss a session, each of the talks were recorded, and are
available to watch [here](https://psysciacc.org/psacon2020-videos/). All
videos that were successfully recorded have been uploaded (although some
have been lost 😢 ).

Whether you attended the conference or not we would like to provide
feedback by taking this short
[survey](https://psysciacc.org/psacon2020-feedback-survey/)! We believe
that each person in our network has a valuable opinion on the conference
that we would like to learn more about as we consider the possibility of
hosting another one in the future.

## Study Updates

-   **PSA 001:** The stage 2 (final) paper was accepted at *Nature Human
    Behaviour* with only minor formatting edits required before
    publication!!!!!!!!!! This marks the true completion of our first
    ever study at the PSA.
-   **PSA 002/003-** The 002 and 003 teams are in the final stages of
    moving our experiments from Open Sesame/Qualtrics to Lab.JS. Thanks
    to the hard work of Merle Schuckart, we have drafts of the new
    programs and are in the process of ensuring that the web versions of
    the studies retain fidelity to the original protocols and
    troubleshooting the studies. The new version of the experiment
    should fully integrate both the 002 and 003 procedures into one
    online protocol, greatly simplifying future data collection.
-   **PSA 004:** Data collection is still going on and will wrap up at
    the end of the year! We do however need more CREP reviewers as we
    wrap up this project at the end of the year. CREP reviewers look
    over each lab's OSF page to ensure that each lab is performing the
    study as planned. If you or someone else is interested please have
    them fill out this
    [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdB7BDtPSI6q_7UxeUcqy4EKNxtYazZwR7P9SVbVKmd6rFBlg/viewform).
-   **PSA 005:** We have finished our latest revision of the stage 1
    manuscript based on our communications with the editor. This should
    be the last revision before stage 1 acceptance. The newest revisions
    were submitted on Wednesday!!!!
-   **PSA 006:** 006 will continue data collection through the end
    of 2020. We have collected lots of great data from all of our
    members and are excited to see this study through to the end.
-   **PSA 007:** PSA's new project: Semantic Priming Across Many
    Languages (SPAML) is just getting started. Learn more by checking
    out the presentation from the conference: [click
    here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LxoMhicyxiVaRNv_3siMs5-1syTPgl24lEws6rR32oc/edit#slide=id.p)!
    The words2manylanguages part of the project is currently recruiting
    all kinds of help. We are trying to create a repository of datasets
    to use as our criterion for the modeling section of this project. We
    downloaded a bunch of them, but we need to clean them up to a
    consistent format (naming, csv column names synced, etc.). Anyone
    who's interested in helping will be given credit via CREDIT (so this
    task would count + reviewing the paper for authorship). You can
    email buchananlab@gmail.com. Join slack or email to be kept updated
    on the two other pre-projects, more announcements on those soon. All
    three will need to be completed as part of the design for the full
    007 project.
-   **PSACR 001/002/003:** Data collection is complete for PSACR 001 and
    003, and PSACR 002 data collection is ending on October 23rd. A
    summary of data collected is available here
    <http://formr.psysciacc.org/shiny/shiny_app/>!

## Director's Statement Installments

Chris is releasing a Director's Statement in individual
posts/installments to solicit feedback and ultimately guide priorities
and activities for the remainder of his Directorship with the PSA. You
can read the opening letter here and see the planned section titles with
tentative release dates
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15NEidpsYOAB77ZaZIgwhJ0OIBaw9_lPuQlfPlCrJ34s/edit?usp=sharing)!

## Community Building Update

At the end of December 2020, Crystal Steltenpohl will be stepping down
as an Assistant Director of the Community Building and Network Expansion
Committee. Her announcement reads:

> I look forward to seeing what new energy the next assistant director
will bring. I have really enjoyed working with Natalia Dutra on this
committee, whose goals of diversity, inclusion, and community building
in the PSA are close to my heart. Of course, even as a non-assistant
director, I will still be involved and support the CBNEC. The director
group is so awesome and open to feedback. I don\'t usually look forward
to committee meetings but the all hands meetings are fun and productive
and informative. The general PSA meetings remind me of why I got into
science. We have an awesome, collaborative community full of talented
people from across the globe.

> While I have no control over who takes my place, I really hope folks
from non-US/CA/EU areas consider going for the position. Having someone
from these geographic regions in a leadership role, especially for this
committee, is crucial for PSA\'s growth and development. I will miss
being CBNEC assistant director but I am SO excited about seeing where
new leadership can take this committee and the PSA more generally.

> If you think you might be even kinda sorta interested in this position,
please DM me on Slack or email me at cnsteltenp@usi.edu! I\'d love to
chat about the group and brainstorm on where it can go from here!

## Data and Methods Update

We have some pretty exciting things happening in the Data and Methods
Committee! We have added a new member to our ranks, Will McAuffille, and
we are ecstatic to get to work more with him! We\'ve started up a
subcommittee on meta science that our very own Nick Fox is leading.
Lastly, we are currently in the midst of a flurry of activity and
progress on the measurement study related to PSA 006.

### Secondary Analysis Challenge

A year after the secondary analysis challenge was announced we have
posted the results and submissions! We are proud to announce that it
seems to have been a success as we had 8 submissions, and we learned new
information from each of them. Each submission script was checked for
computational reproducibility by two members of our team (Abigail Noyce
and Patrick Forscher). To read more, please visit the
[blogpost](https://psysciacc.org/news/2020-09-14_incentivizing-discovery-through-the-psa001-secondary-analysis-challenge.html)!

## IT'S THE MAP!!!

Nicholas Coles has updated our membership map and it looks sick! We
continue to grow as a network day by day but it had been some time since
we had updated the map. The previous map had us at 760 researchers and
now we are up to 1021 and counting. Head over to
the [website](https://psysciacc.org/map/) to take a gander out how much
we have grown!
