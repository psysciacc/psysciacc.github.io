In response to the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic, the Psychological
Science Accelerator (PSA) issued a
[call](https://psysciacc.org/2020/03/13/the-psa-calls-for-rapid-and-impactful-study-proposals-on-covid-19/)
on March 13th for rapid and impactful proposals to understand the
psychological and behavioral aspects of the pandemic. The response to
our call has been both enthusiastic and heartwarming \-- we received
over 60 submissions within the four-day window. The Psychological
Science Accelerator is the largest research network of researchers in
the social sciences. We now have over 500 labs from over 77 countries.
This network includes the top scientists in psychology, with expertise
on study design, data analysis, ethics, study management, and
translation. Researchers from all over the entire world submit their
study proposals to this network. We strongly believe our combined
resources can make an impact in this humanitarian crisis.

We are working
quickly to select the very best proposals from the 60+ submissions that
we received. Based on our current pool, the topics of our COVID-19
studies could range from behavioral interventions to improve adherence
to preventive health measures, to interventions to fight fake news about
COVID-19, to methods to reduce the anxiety that accompanies social
distancing. We are confident that our COVID-19 initiative will make an
impact. However, the initiative would be all the more impactful if we
had more *financial* resources at our disposal. These financial
resources would allow us to:

-   Pay for participant compensation at sites without large research
    budgets
-   Use recruitment methods in some sites that do not rely on
    convenience sampling
-   Pay for social media advertising to assist with recruitment efforts
-   Provide stipends to translators so that our projects can be
    conducted in non-English languages
-   Provide a stipend for a project manager who could ensure the full
    project happens on a rapid timetable

In short, financial resources would allow us to have an even greater
chance to generate informative research papers and datasets. Because we
plan to share these datasets and papers freely and openly, these
research products should allow us to substantially improve our knowledge
of the behavioral science of COVID-19, thereby contributing to policy
discussions about how to mitigate COVID-19's pernicious public health
effects. If you would like to help us in this endeavor, you can
contribute to our financial resources via our

The community response to COVID-19 has been extremely gratifying. Let's
use our collective skills and resources to understand and respond to
this evolving crisis.
