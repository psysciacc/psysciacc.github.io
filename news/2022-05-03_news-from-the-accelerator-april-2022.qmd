Special Call for Studies -- Studying Generalizability with Global
Samples

The Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA), supported by the John
Templeton Foundation (JTF), welcomes study proposals to test the
generalizability of phenomena related to JTF strategic priorities with
large, global samples.

To be eligible for this call, projects must investigate questions
related to one or more of the strategic priorities of JTF: the dynamics
of religious change, intellectual humility, religious cognition, the
science of character virtue, and health, religion, and spirituality. 

Projects selected through this special call will be advertised to
members of the PSA network in collaboration with the proposing authors.
Each study will be supported by \$40,000 of direct funding for data
collection. The proposing author teams will also be collectively
supported by 3 full-time scientific staff members (a Research
Coordinator, a Postdoctoral Researcher, and a Research Scientist), an
additional ⅓ time senior staff member (Dr. Christopher R. Chartier), a ½
time staff member equivalent team of undergraduate research assistants,
several members of PSA committees (at their discretion), and members of
the network at large (at their discretion).
