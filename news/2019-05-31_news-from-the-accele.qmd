Accelerators,

You can read up on our most recent month of PSA activities in our May newsletter (https://psysciacc.org/news/2019-05-31_news-from-the-accelerator-may-2019.html) .

The big headline news is that we will release a detailed call for studies on June 15th and the submission deadline will be September 15th. We also seek several new committee members, provide updates on all 6 studies, and a reminder that tomorrow (June 1st) is the last day to apply for the PSA postdoctoral position.

Thank you for everything that you do to accelerate psychological science!
