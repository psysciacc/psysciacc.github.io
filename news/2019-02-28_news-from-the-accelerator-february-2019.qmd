This month (our 18th month!) we have made progress on PSA policy
documents, our search for funding (don\'t get too excited\...no big news
yet), and all 6 of our in-progress studies. Also of note, we\'re now up
to 428 unique labs! Thank you so much for everyone who has gotten
involved in the PSA!

# PSA Policies

-   The [membership
    policy](https://psysciacc.org/membership/){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"} was ratified in our most recent vote and
    is now official PSA policy. This will lead to slight changes in our
    onboarding process for the PSA generally and specific PSA studies.
    In the near future we will distribute a one-time form for those
    already in our membership roster to affirm the code of conduct and
    the mission of the PSA (be on the lookout for that!).
-   We now call for final comments and votes on our [Personnel,
    Appointments, and Elections Policy
    Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aXjXwouFc6wvcyy7IFmEKGL0j2yxzYukyI_YFf6sZtM/edit){target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"}. PSA members will receive the draft
    policy via email and have until March 15th, 2019 to vote.

# Updates from the Funding Committee

The funding committee has been working extremely hard to identify and
pursue promising funding opportunities for the PSA. We all owe a big
thanks to Neil Lewis Jr., Thuy-vy Nguyen, and Hans IJzerman for their
efforts in organizing our funding search and attempts to date. Here are
some notable attempts:

-   We have requested an NSF grant (under review)
-   We requested a Marie Curie grant (but it was rejected :( )
-   In the Netherlands, we will collaborate with Marcel van Assen to
    request an Open Competition Grant
-   Diego Forero is requesting an internal grant at his University to
    create a PSA hub
-   EU PSA researchers are working on requesting a Synergy Grant. Two
    centers for this grant have been identified, but we will want to
    identify two more. Those interested in participating can contact
    Hans IJzerman.

PSA researchers can identify smaller grant opportunities and contact the
funding committee (Neil Lewis and Thuy-Vy Vu) to investigate
possibilities. We are always looking for ways to support the PSA and to
support PSA members through grants, large and small. Finally, central to
our future funding requests is to work on a long-term vision document,
detailing what we are able to accomplish with our current support and
capacity, but also what we would plan to do with additional support to
make an even bigger impact on psychological science. Chris Chartier is
taking the lead on this, and will share drafts in the coming months.

# **Study Updates**

Now that we have 6 studies concurrently in preparation or data
collection, some of us are having trouble keeping them straight when
discussing their status! So, we\'ve started using 3-digit codes and
2-word titles for our in-progress studies. Here are some mini-updates on
all 6 PSA studies:

-   001 FACE PERCEPTION. The study is now up and running, in at least
    demo mode, for 22 of our data collection languages. You can test out
    all versions via [these demo links](https://psa.psy.gla.ac.uk/). We
    have now collected data from 3,497 total raters across 9 world
    regions and are well on our way to meeting our September target for
    completing data collection!
-   002 OBJECT ORIENTATION & 003 GENDERED PREJUDICE. These two studies
    are \"bundled\" for a shared data collection session. Now that 002
    has an in principle acceptance in hand from *Psychonomic Bulletin
    and Review,* we have decided to pursue results-blind review (rather
    than a registered report) for 003. We have initiated IRB and
    translation processes for these studies in the hopes of initiating
    data collection quite soon.
-   004 TRUE BELIEF. We are still in the \"revise and resubmit\" process
    for this study at *Advances in Methods and Practices in
    Psychological Science.* We hope to have news of an in principle
    acceptance to share soon!
-   005 STEREOTYPE THREAT. The leadership team for this study has made
    considerable recent progress on making final design decisions and we
    will be sharing IRB materials with data collection labs in the
    coming weeks.
-   006 TROLLEY PROBLEM. This study now includes a team of 130 labs
    across 40 countries! We are hoping to submit as a registered report
    to *Nature Human Behaviour.* Our next step is to initiate IRB
    submission in all data collection labs.

# Spreading the Word

Members have presented, or otherwise shared, information about the PSA
