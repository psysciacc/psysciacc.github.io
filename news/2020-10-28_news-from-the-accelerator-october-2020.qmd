## Study Capacity Policy up for a Vote

In an effort to more systematically assess our study acceptance
capacity, we have drafted a new PSA policy document. All members of the
PSA, please read this
[document,](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hdJesAgxjhgjRUUXFd3QQDcfouRPH1W2sdZRKlxbsME/edit?usp=sharing){rel="noreferrer noopener"
target="_blank"} and then vote yes or no, by logging into the [member
site](https://member.psysciacc.org/){rel="noreferrer noopener"
target="_blank"} and finding the voting form under the \"your tasks\"
heading on the main page.

## Data Collection Updates

-   **PSA 004:** We have 2640 participants in over 50 labs. The deadline
    to sign up is past, but if your lab hasn\'t started data collection
    then we will need you to start by November 15. Data collection ends
    in December.
-   **PSA 006:** 006 is in the final stages of data collection. We are
    going strong but are not accepting any new labs at this time. Data
    collection is set to end at the end of 2020.
-   **PSACR 001/002/003:** Data collection for the PSACR bundle was
    completed on October 23rd! Considering people who completed at least
    90% of questions on a given component of the survey, our estimated
    *Ns* are: 44,217 for the general questions; 16,618 for Study 1 (Loss
    Gain); 20,805 for Study 2 (Cognitive Reappraisal); and 18,594 for
    Study 3 (Self Determination). We also met our goal for Study 2 of
    having 35 countries with *N* \>= 200*.* Anyone can explore Ns by
    study, language, and different percent completion thresholds at
    <http://formr.psysciacc.org/shiny/shiny_app/>.

## Publication Updates

-   **PSA 001:** The final copy of the paper has been accepted and we
    are working on responding to the various editorial formatting
    requests prior to publication! This is our first study to have a
    final, Stage 2, acceptance.
-   **PSA 002/003:** We are currently waiting on the journal editor's
    comments about the modifications we made earlier. He will give us
    their decisions and suggestions in a few days, so we will have a lot
    of editing to do soon!
-   **PSA 005:** We have received Stage 1 acceptance at Nature Human
    Behavior! [Here](https://psyarxiv.com/6hju9/) is a preprint of the
    manuscript if y'all want to give it a read!


## Training Committee Update

We are trying to get some feedback from you all on what kind of training
you think you need in order to be successful in the PSA and the many
studies.
[Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSel88f6kNbkmPslGPc90q877Etcf_-ptTqMA2iLzkpIKAjG-w/viewform)
is a google form you can all fill out to provide some feedback on what
you think would be helpful.


## Community Building and Network Expansion Committee Update

From Crystal:

We have a position opening in the Community Building and Network
Expansion Committee in December. We really hope folks from non-US/CA/EU
areas consider going for the position. Having someone from these
geographic regions in a leadership role, especially for this committee,
is crucial for PSA\'s growth and development. I will miss being CBNEC
assistant director but I am SO excited about seeing where new leadership
can take this committee and the PSA in general.

If you think you might be even kinda sorta interested in this position,
please DM me on Slack or email me at cnsteltenp@usi.edu! I\'d love to
chat about the group and brainstorm on where it can go from here!

## Gathering feedback on a possible PSA translation service

PSA member, Adeyemi Adetula, would like to solicit your feedback on
potential demand for a paid translation service for African languages in
terms of interest and to assess available funds to dedicate to such a
service.

In general, there is little research on African populations in
psychology. Even in the Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA), African
participation in multi-site studies has been poor, with a recent project
including just two (out of several thousand) African indigenous
languages. To facilitate inclusion and improve generalizability of
psychology, we propose a paid translation service for African languages
and thereafter offer a more general translation service (for full
details regarding this service, see
[here](https://corelab.blog/psatranslation/)).

**Who could use this service?** Any researcher interested in conducting
research amongst African populations.

**What do I stand to benefit?** First, users would get a high-quality
translation. Quality of these translations is of high priority and we
intend to adopt the already established translation procedures of the
PSA. This procedure required a forward translation (source to targeted
language), a back translation (serving as validation), editing
(reconciling text difference of first version and validation version),
external reading (feedback from potential respondents), cultural
adjustment, proofreading, and implementation (transfer of translated
note into a survey software). Second, such a translation service allows
one to conduct research in African populations as we will also try to
connect users with local researchers.

**Survey.** We invite you to give us feedback on this proposed service
via this short (5 minute)
[survey](https://survey.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2ayaVaYccAsuKsB)
(if you are instead interested in being a translator, you can fill in
the survey
[here](https://survey.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5hH4NjtBNHVGu7H)).
