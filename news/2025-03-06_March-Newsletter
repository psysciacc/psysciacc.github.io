### *SPSP Roundup*

Great to see several of our fantastic PSA members presenting at the annual Society for Personality and Social Psychology (SPSP) convention in Denver, Colorado! The conference featured outstanding contributions from many Accelerators, including Sergio Barbosa, Barnabas Szaszi, Jing Lin, Shuxian Jin, Nicholas Coles, and Karen Akin, who shared their important research through engaging talks and posters. It was truly inspiring to see PSA members making such a powerful impact and showcasing the incredible work being done within the PSA community!

Building on this momentum, PSA director Savannah Lewis and Assistant Director Nadia Corral Frias led a thought-provoking roundtable on improving representation, access, and justice in psychological science.

A big shoutout to Valerie Jones Taylor [PSA 005 - Stereotype Threat project](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/6hju9_v1) for representing the PSA 005 team and sharing our findings to a packed audience! Your presentation was a standout and a great reflection of the hard work put into the project.
