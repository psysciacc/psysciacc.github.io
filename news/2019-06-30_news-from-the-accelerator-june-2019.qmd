June was an action-packed month for the Accelerator. This news roundup
includes a new call for studies, exciting updates on several current
studies, info on the PSA's first hire (!), and tons of links to other
great things PSA members are up to.

## 2019 Call for Studies

We welcome new study submissions now through September 15th. A detailed
description can be found in the [blogpost announcing the
call](https://psysciacc.org/news/2019-06-15_the-psychological-science-accelerator-calls-for-study-submissions.html).
Please do not hesitate to respond to this email with any questions you
have about the submission, review, and selection process.

The PSA\'s First Hire

Patrick Forscher has accepted a postdoc at Université Grenoble Alpes in
Hans IJzerman's lab to coordinate and write grants to fund the PSA. The
first grant they're working on is a Synergy Grant, which could provide
big-time funding for PSA activities. Receiving the grant would have
major implications for the PSA, so you'll very probably be hearing more
about the grant preparations in the coming months. Congrats, Patrick!

## 002 Object Orientation and 003 Gendered Prejudice: Ready for Data Collection

This bundled project will now begin to roll out data collection! 003\'s
[preregistration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16vh_qNWyhWSSK5tbNowt2CUPdPPwEYri59KXcjhjXeM/edit){target="_blank"}
was finalized, we\'ve recorded a [demo
video](https://osf.io/pe6ja/){target="_blank"} of a mock data collection
session, and have established the c[ollaboration
agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B273zUHTxmL9vE6rcSRdcV88GiDaDrVLS181QQrH5uw/edit){target="_blank"}
describing how contributions on both studies will be credited. If
you\'re a member lab for this study, be on the lookout for a detailed
update email on next steps very soon!

## 004 True Belief: Accepted in Principle at AMPPS and Ready for Data Collection

The Accelerated CREP collaboration is also ready to begin data
collection, after receiving an in principle acceptance at *Advances in
Methods and Practices in Psychological Science*. You can read more about
the project, and detailed instructions for how to get involved, in this
highly informative [blog
post](https://psysciacc.org/news/2019-06-29_update-on-the-accelerated-crep-a-collaborative-crep-replication-project-powered-by-the-psa.html){target="_blank"}
from project leader Braeden Hall.

## Planning for PSA Activities at SIPS

Many Accelerators will be attending this year\'s meeting of the [Society
for the Improvement of Psychological
Science](https://improvingpsych.org/){target="_blank"} in Rotterdam.
Sau-chin Chen has put together a [google
sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LXUwDkTy1hPKm2ZxnmbaeTaAE-BMU-u4l2xPlBEQ7A4/edit#gid=0){target="_blank"}
highlighting sessions led by PSA members. There will also be 5 PSA
specific work meetings at the conference. Follow the conversation on our
Slack workspace to see the time and location for those as they are
determined.

## Project Monitoring Committee

The Project Monitoring Committee has changed its name to the Project
Monitoring Committee. The initials and role will remain the same:
Project Monitors (PMs) will monitor, encourage, and track progress on
projects. They'll still be the person on the team who maintains a
big-picture view, has an eye towards adherence to PSA policies, and
helps submitting authors anticipate and overcome issues. The new name
captures this role better, and makes more clear that the PM isn't
responsible for making progress on a project or leading a project.

## T-Shirts and Stickers

We are selling PSA t-shirts and stickers. You can reply to this email
with order details (sizes and quantities) and address and we will ship
to you. Short sleeve shirts are \$15, long-sleeve shirts are \$20, and
stickers are \$5. You can see pictures of each

## Other Collaboration Opportunities

-   Several members of the PSA have started a MetaResearch Hub. Anyone
    interested in meta-research should check it out. You can join a
    project or share your ideas to find collaborators:
    [bit.do/MetaResearchHub](https://t.co/BoDwtgYibi?amp=1)
-   Rick Klein, Olivier Dujols, and Hans IJzerman are looking for
    collaborators on a new (non-PSA) cross-national project to assess
    whether individual differences exist in risk distribution, social
    thermoregulation, and food sharing. The project home is at the
    [OSF](https://osf.io/ghbzk/), the current proposal is in [Google
    Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eNj50TWWA4dNvrNt-jWLJ-N3PPnATAbK5V9CnBnW7B8/edit?usp=sharing),
    and the current collaborator list in [Google
    Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_p4xU52a3NupIlHnKee-Ducgm1TOIGVGv8qvcX6t5fc/edit?usp=sharing).
