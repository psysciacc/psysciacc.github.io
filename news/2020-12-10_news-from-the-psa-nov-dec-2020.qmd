WOW... 2020.

It has been a wild year for all of us. From quarantine to scheduled
grocery visits and walks, we have adapted a lot this past year. I want
to wrap up this year by taking some to reflect on all that our network
has accomplished.

The PSA has been able to successfully implement three new studies in
just a few short months. We have added several new initiatives such as
the director statements, the first PSA conference, and our most recent
blog post about the PSA's capacity. Along with the achievement of
finishing data collection for several of our current studies (PSA 004,
PSACR 001/002/003, and PSA 006).

It is thanks to all of our members and directors for making this
possible. Thank you for continuing to be present in our studies and for
your willingness to collaborate. We appreciate all of our PSA members
but we want to give a special shoutout to our project teams for their
hard work to keep the studies running in a pandemic.

We enter the new year with the prospect of new studies and the PSA 001
paper in press!

**Study updates:**

-   **PSA 001-** Paper is in-press! It will be published with Nature
    Human Behavior in January.
-   **PSA 002/003-** The leadership team for the 002/003 bundle of
    studies has been hard at work, creating an online version of the 002
    study protocol that will not rely on in-person data collection. This
    new protocol was recently approved by the editors of the Psychonomic
    Bulletin and Review. We are now testing the 002 online link.Â 
-   **PSA 004-** We are no longer taking new teams and we would like
    data to be collected by the end of the year, with final CREP
    submissions by the end of January.
-   **PSA 005-** This project is currently on hold until the US gets
    better control of COVID.Â 
-   **PSA 006-** We are in the last month of data collection for 006!!!
    Thank you to everyone who has been a part of this process so far.Â 
-   **PSA 007-** PSA007 will be starting on pre-projects after the
    holidays, please email <buchananlab@gmail.com> if you are interested
    in joining.
-   **PSACR Bundle-** The submitting author teams are hard at work
    analyzing data and writing their manuscript drafts! Meanwhile, we
    (the admin team) are developing a data management plan (figuring out
    exactly how and when we will share the data). We also, on an ongoing
    basis, are working to make sure that everyone's contributions are
    accurately documented.

**Study Capacity Policy:Â **

Last month we voted on the [study capacity
policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hdJesAgxjhgjRUUXFd3QQDcfouRPH1W2sdZRKlxbsME/edit)
for the PSA. As described in our Study Capacity Policy, study capacity
is determined by the PSA's data collection capacity or the amount and
kind of participant data the PSA can collect in a given year, and its
administrative capacity, or its ability to perform the administrative
tasks required to collect participant data. The study capacity has
passed and will go into effect.Â 

**How many resources does the PSA possess?**

[This
blog](https://psysciacc.org/2020/12/04/how-many-resources-does-the-psa-possess/)
discusses the PSA's first study capacity report, which contains a ton of
interesting findings of our network. It also addresses the resources
that the PSA currently has and will need in the future. Make sure you
take a look at this important resource for the PSA.Â 

**The financial cost of the PSA's vision.**

We recently released [this
blog](https://psysciacc.org/2020/12/11/the-financial-cost-of-the-psas-vision/)
on describing the need for funding to continue our vision. Patrick
Forscher and Hans Ijzerman argue that in order to fulfill a maximalist
vision we need to secure funding.

**PSACR hackathon:**

The admin team for the PSACR projects is hard at work preparing the
datasets for release. As part of this process, we held two hack-a-thons
to code the free text responses that participants entered about where
they were located into more structured and usable location data. We also
cross-checked our initial coded responses to ensure that our final
dataset is accurate. The work involved sorting through two spreadsheets
--- one with 2000+ rows and one with a bit less than 200 --- and
deciding on the meaning of free text that was often incomplete and in
non-English languages.

Fortunately, these hack-a-thons were a huge success! We were able to
accomplish the work quickly and efficiently. Huge thanks go out to the
people who volunteered their time to make this happen, including Biljana
Gjoneska, Anna Szabelska, Martin Vasilev, AmÃ©lie Gourdon-Kanhukamwe, Jen
Beaudry, and Niels van Berkel. Thanks also go out to the hardworking
members of the admin team who prepped, facilitated, and administered the
hack and its resulting data, including Erin Buchanan, Hannah Moshontz,
and Patrick Forscher.

**Clinical Chapter**

We recently wrote a chapter about how our network might help with
clinical research for an upcoming book on questionable research
practices (and solutions) in clinical psychology. We think there\'s
potential to explore important clinical questions with the PSA! Check it
out [here](https://psyarxiv.com/qwy4k/)!

**Coffee Station Channel on Slack:**

In a physical office, you would have a coffee station or a place where
you can take a break and refresh with your co-workers. The coffee
station often becomes a place where you can share about what is going on
in your life and a place to just take a break from your busy work
schedule. We want to be able to get to know more people in our vast
network. Therefore, Savannah decided to create a virtual coffee station.
We will be using this channel to get to know each other and possibly
host some fun coffee hangouts. Head over to slack to check out the
[coffee station](https://app.slack.com/client/T7DBVAQBX/C01F4SNRYGG).Â
