## WHAT'S NEW IN BIG TEAM SCIENCE

### Moving towards a truly inclusive behavioral science

In [Communications Psychology](https://doi.org/10.1038/s44271-024-00179-1), authors call for more responsible practices and co-authorship to promote global equity in knowledge production. They also conceptualized making assumptions based on skewed knowledge (MASKing) as a threat to diverse open science. Several PSA members are co-authors.

## Database for Eyewitness identification research

A team including PSA member Stefana Juncu created a database of crime videos and mugshots for eyewitness identification research. Read more in their paper published in [Behavior Research Methods](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-024-02585-z). **[The database on OSF](https://osf.io/vrj3u/)** is accessible by request for academic research that has received ethics approval.

## FEATURED EVENT

### *SIPS 2025 in Budapest and online*

This will be the 10th annual conference of the Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science (SIPS). The program will focus on evaluating the reform thus far and gathering new momentum to improve science. For those traveling to Budapest, there will be sightseeing, hiking, and dinner on a boat on the Danube! Find out more at [www.improvingpsych.org/SIPS2025/](www.improvingpsych.org/SIPS2025/).

## PSA Member Update

One of the most amazing aspects of the PSA is the powerful connections it fosters among members! We're thrilled to see this in action as two PSA members team up at NYU‚Äîan incredible example of collaboration and networking in our community! üéâüëè

R√©mi Th√©riault recently started as a postdoctoral fellow at the [Social Identity & Morality Lab](https://www.jayvanbavel.com/people) directed by Jay Van Bavel at New York University (NYU). Both are PSA members. R√©mi Th√©riault will be working on developing a long-term intervention to reduce polarization in the currently tense US political climate.
