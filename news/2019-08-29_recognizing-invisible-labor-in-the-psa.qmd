One of the biggest threats to the sustainability of large-scale
collaborations is the rewards system in place for scholarly labor.
Scholarly labor is rewarded with credit for scholarly products.
Typically, people scan authorship lists to observe whom to credit, with
the lion's share going to the first- and last-listed authors. This
disproportionate assignment of credit serves as a disincentive for
collaborating on papers with author lists that are too long: if the bulk
of the credit goes to the first and last authors, middle authorship is
only worthwhile when earned through a minimal investment of effort. This
disincentive weighs especially heavily on multi-site projects, which
require dozens, if not hundreds, of people to pull off successfully. The
problem is still harder in a standing organization like the PSA.
Maintaining an organization requires a lot of administrative labor --
labor that is often invisible if there aren't mechanisms in place to
surface it. In academia, we see this invisible labor problem on a small
scale in the typical treatment of academic lab managers: these people
are necessary to produce the science that graces academic journals, but
are seldom, if ever, properly credited. Given that the success of the
PSA depends on ongoing administrative labor, we would like to find ways
to disrupt the perverse incentive structure that inhibits standing
collaborations in academia. The PSA already endorses a [contributorship
model](https://psyarxiv.com/dt6e8/) of awarding credit for scholarly
products and uses the [CRediT
taxonomy](https://www.casrai.org/credit.html) to show project
contributions. We will also be unveiling the results of some ongoing
initiatives to implement CRediT when we share the results of [our first
study](https://psysciacc.org/001-face-perception/). One additional
initiative that we've started is to award stipends for the
administrative roles that people fill for PSA studies. For now, we will
only be giving six of these stipends, and the stipends themselves are
relatively small -- \$400 -- but, if we are able to secure regular
sources of funding for the PSA, paying our staff is one of our highest
priorities. You can help us increase the size and number of these
stipends by donating to our [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/psysciacc)
(and you can read more about our ongoing Patreon campaign
[here](https://psysciacc.org/2019/08/27/the-psas-patreon-sustainability-drive/)).
Finally, we want to make some of the invisible contributions to the PSA
more visible by highlighting some of the contributors. Below, we profile
five of these people, each at a different place in their scientific
career, all of whom have made outstanding contributions to the PSA and
its projects. Only by recognizing the value of contributions like theirs
will we subvert the system that heaps credit on the few at the expense
of the many. **Profiles of five major contributors to the PSA**
**Nicholas Coles** Nicholas Coles is a fifth year Social Psychology PhD
student at the University of Tennessee. He's a member of both the
Project Monitoring and Community Building committees at the PSA.
![unnamed](images/unnamed.png){.alignnone
.wp-image-561 width="221" height="224"} Nick has been a rockstar Project
Monitor for [PSA001 (face
perception)](https://psysciacc.org/001-face-perception/). As the first
project monitor for any PSA project, he has helped define what project
monitors do, and has made a myriad of tracking sheets, and forms, and
other materials that have served as templates for similar tools in other
PSA projects. As the PSA001 project monitor, Nick has also served as the
primary point of contact for an author list of nearly 200 people. Nick's
efforts have helped produce a data collection effort spanning 11,000
participants, 48 countries, and 28 languages. As if that weren't enough,
Nick also developed a web application that displays [an interactive map
of the PSA
network](https://nicholas-coles.shinyapps.io/PSA_Map_Prototype/). If you
want to find out more about Nick and his work, check out his
[website](https://nicholas-a-coles.weebly.com/). **Anna Szabelska** Anna
finished her PhD in Cognition at Queen's University Belfast and is
looking for her next adventure. She was recently accepted to the [NASA
Datanauts](https://open.nasa.gov/explore/datanauts/2018/fall-2018/)
project, a program that applies data science methods to NASA datasets.
This program, along with her work for the PSA, is the coolest thing
that's happened in her professional life. ![pasted image

.wp-image-560 width="224" height="221"} Anna has been an exceptionally
active member of the PSA from the very start. She was a founding member
of the Data and Methods Committee and helped draft its
[bylaws](https://osf.io/p65qe/). She has also co-led a project to create
a standard psychology dataset format
([Psych-DS](https://psych-ds.github.io/)), which would enable projects
ranging from automated meta-analysis to standardized data analysis
tools. She has also played a critical role on [PSA002 (object
orientation)](https://psysciacc.org/002-object-orientation/), and in
that capacity, she has helped define what methodologists do in PSA
studies. One of the more interesting outcomes from that work is a novel
meta-science initiative -- prediction markets to determine how accurate
experts are in predicting whether the object orientation effect
replicates in a given language. Finally, Anna has shared her enthusiasm
for the PSA with anyone who is willing to listen, giving official talks
on the PSA for RLadies Dublin, Women Who Code, and Google Women
Techmakers, and co-organizing a PSA
[workshop](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j23z0ZM9suNV-cQlJAqoQvqJr2ILA22q5D-1sSTxhkY/edit)
and
[unconference](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AYKsEgd38zymRyEndp5FLJEgSJDSYWtzYsUmc7yq58E/edit).

profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-szabelska). **Jeremy Miller**
Jeremy Miller is a Professor of Psychology at Willamette University in
Salem, OR. Jeremy is on sabbatical and has generously volunteered a
chunk of his sabbatical time to working with the PSA. ![pasted image 0
(1)](images/pasted-image-0-1.png){.alignnone
.wp-image-557 width="213" height="495"} Jeremy is the Project Monitor
for two PSA projects, [PSA002 (object
orientation)](https://psysciacc.org/002-object-orientation/) and [PSA003
(gendered prejudice)](https://psysciacc.org/003-gendered-prejudice/),
which have been bundled together for the purpose of efficient data
collection. Jeremy coordinates communications between the many, many
parties involved in pulling off a project involving 49 labs, 16
languages, and two separate projects, with an eye toward ensuring all
parties adhere to the PSA's ever-evolving policies. His effectiveness in
this role is informed by his experience as the head of a data collection
lab for [PSA001 (face
perception)](https://psysciacc.org/001-face-perception/). Jeremy also
serves on the Project Monitor committee, working with Project Monitors
across PSA projects to ensure that the PSA uses its resources
effectively and efficiently. You can read more about Jeremy and his lab
at his [lab website](http://millerj73.wixsite.com/wumemoryandcognition).
**Marton Kovacs** Marton is a second-year master\'s student at Eotvos
Lorand University, Hungary and is a huge fan of both the PSA and the
broader movement to improve psychological research. He is planning to
apply to PhD programs to do meta-scientific research, focusing
specifically on ways to increase research efficiency by minimizing human
error. ![pasted image 0
(2)](images/pasted-image-0-2-1.png){.alignnone
.wp-image-558 width="194" height="196"} Even though Marton is relatively
early in his scientific career, he has played a critical role in swiftly
moving the [PSA006 (moral
dilemmas)](https://psysciacc.org/006-trolley-problem/) from conception
to a submitted Registered Report. As Data Manager, he drafted the data
management plan that will ensure that the data from more than 130
participating labs are credible, transparently shared, and efficiently
collected. He is also helping develop tools that will help solve some of
the unique problems that large-scale collaborations face. This includes
the problem of properly crediting contributions mentioned in this post:
Marton is developing a Shiny app that helps authors create human- and
machine-readable contributorship information so that the "invisible
contributions" to multi-author projects are made visible. You can find
out more about Marton on his
[website](http://decisionlab.elte.hu/members/marton-kovacs/). **Sophia
Christin Weissgerber** Sophia C. Weissgerber recently started a postdoc
position in cognitive psychology at the University of Kassel in Germany.
She is survey manager for [PSA004 (true
belief)](https://psysciacc.org/004-true-belief/), a partnership with the
Collaborative Replication and Education Project
([CREP](https://osf.io/wfc6u/)), which uses multi-site replications to
provide training and professional growth experiences for students and
instructors. Since Sophia is a huge fan of the CREP-project, she likes
to expose her 3rd semester students to real-world hands-on research
experience, for example replication of [Griskevicius et al.
(2010)](https://osf.io/9vgbz/). ![pasted image 0
(3)](images/pasted-image-0-3.png){.alignnone
.wp-image-559 width="188" height="371"} Sophia performed a feat of
programming wizardry for PSA004, implementing an experimental design in
the online platform SocSciSurvey for a project involving 54 sites (and
counting), as well as 26 countries and 12 languages. Each site requires
a unique survey and survey link, so Sophia also does extensive
coordination with the participating sites to personalize each survey for
each site. This labor is critical for the project's success. Sophia also
enjoys participating in other PSA-projects, e.g. [PSA001 (face
perception)](https://psysciacc.org/001-face-perception/). She is really
excited about the PSA community and work (quote: \"super-awesome\") and
together with Hans IJzerman, Rick Klein, and Anna van \'t Veer, she is
currently working on a non-technical primer on how to conduct code
review in psychological science. You can read more about Sophia and her
