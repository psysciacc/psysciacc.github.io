Accelerators,

Happy Holidays! We are wrapping up this wild year with much to celebrate. The PSA has been able to successfully implement three new studies, added several new initiatives, and completed data collection for five studies! So, thank you for being an amazing network of dedicated psychologists. Be sure to read up on the last newsletter of 2020 (https://psysciacc.org/news/2020-12-10_news-from-the-psa-nov-dec-2020.html) and we look forward to collaborating with you in 2021!
