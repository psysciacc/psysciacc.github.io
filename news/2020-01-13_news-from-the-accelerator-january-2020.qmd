Happy New Year from the PSA! The end of 2019 was full of progress on
many exciting fronts, and we have big plans for the first quarter of
2020. Here we summarize the most important and potentially actionable
items for PSA members or other observers.

## 2019 By the Numbers

Our network now includes 760 researchers, representing 548 labs, in 72
countries. Our website received 37,242 visits in 2019 for 66,334 total
since October 2017, and our preprints have now been downloaded 4,954,
collectively. Check out this [great new

## Recent Coverage

The PSA has been covered in a few media outlets in the past several
months. Check out this [excellent
article](https://undark.org/2019/11/20/psychologists-replication-crisis/){target="_blank"},
first appearing in UnDark and later being picked up by [NPR
news](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/12/13/787567309/can-a-research-accelerator-solve-the-psychology-replication-crisis){target="_blank"}.
Additionally, this [short radio
blurb](https://www.wksu.org/post/exploradio-putting-new-face-psychological-research){target="_blank"}
has quotes from Chris Chartier, Jessica Flake, and Eric Hehman, and
McGill University [recently

Jessica Flake\'s new grant award and planned measurement invariance
project through the PSA.

## 2019 Project Summaries and Status Updates

Our main focus in 2019 was making progress on all 6 of our selected
studies. Each project made big strides.

-   001 Face Perception: In 2019, we completed the first PSA project
    (PSA001), which involved 214 authors and 11,481 participants from 11
    world regions, and 41 countries. Currently, the Stage 2 Registered
    Report is under review at *Nature Human Behaviour*. For this
    project, we also launched the [Secondary Analysis
    Challenge](https://psysciacc.org/2019/09/01/introducing-the-psa001-secondary-analysis-challenge/){target="_blank"},
    which grants 10 awards of \$200 to research teams that create and
    execute a pre-registered re-analysis of the project data. Currently,
    this secondary challenge has 8 submissions and all have been checked
    for computational reproducibility.
-   002 Object Orientation and 003 Gendered Prejudice: 2019 was a busy
    year for the 002 & 003 team. We translated our materials into 16
    different languages and implemented our procedure across 19
    countries. We have completed data collection at 23 different sites,
    with more sites continuing their data collection into the spring. We
    hope to have the Stage 2 Registered Report manuscript under review
    at *Psychonomic Bulletin & Review* in 2020.
-   004 True Belief: The Accelerated CREP collaboration is really
    picking up steam - 39 teams are collecting data (and more are
    welcome to join in
    [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdUif1jYxmf_Mr6svuPm3oqBC7vm3EjbiBdewiqNgzU-Iz7ng/viewform)
    \-- there is information at the top of the form with helpful links).
    We plan to wrap up data collection around June and work on the final
    manuscript shortly thereafter, to be reviewed as a Stage 2
    Registered Report at *Advances in Methods and Practices in
    Psychological Science*. There are still plenty of opportunities to
    get involved. Contact <jordan.wagge@avila.edu> or
    <crep.psych@gmail.com> for more information.
-   005 Stereotype Threat: In 2019, we drafted the initial submission of
    our Stage 1 Registered Report for *Nature Human Behaviour* and
    received a strong revise and resubmit. We also submitted a [revised
    version](https://psyarxiv.com/6hju9/) of the manuscript and are
    still waiting to hear back about the revision's status. Finally, we
    recruited 27 collaborating labs to join the project, all of whom
    have secured IRB approval. If you wish to join too, you can read
    more about the project, and sign up as a collaborator,
    [here](https://psysciacc.org/2018/10/19/a-large-scale-multi-site-examination-of-stereotype-threat-across-varying-operationalizations-a-newly-selected-accelerator-study/).
-   006 Moral Thinking: In 2019, [this
    project\'s](https://psysciacc.org/006-trolley-problem/){target="_blank"}
    team also drafted their initial submission of a Stage 1 Registered
    Report and submitted it *Nature Human Behaviour,* received a
    positive revise and resubmit, [submitted a
    revision](https://psyarxiv.com/9uaqm/){target="_blank"}, received
    another small R&R :), and are completing the new round of revisions
    now. We have 147 labs signed up to collect 18,637 potential
    participants. Most labs are ready to test the link and collect data!
    If you are interested in joining, you can sign up by [filling out
    this
    form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1kWdtip7nm7OqgeNieUbqahKxj69bNcFFCYQCd4yym5o/edit){target="_blank"}.
    Every lab is welcome, but we are specifically searching for
    collaborators who could collect data from at least 100 participants
    in India, South-Korea, Japan, or Thailand. The experiment will be
    run online, so collaborators can simply have to send out a link, and
    participants are not *required* to come to the lab.

## Ratified Policy

The [Analysis Plan Approval
Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CIj5M91SnZr1GEGA9Jup4CVRgClozVoY2yNKV8NMMT8/edit#heading=h.x22gltabenuo){target="_blank"}
is now ratified by vote of the network. This policy was initiated by the
Data and Methods Committee, and its drafting and editing was led by
Peder Isager. Thank you for the great work on this!

## Funding Search Update

-   **Synergy grant submitted.** Patrick Forscher and Hans IJzerman led
    the drafting of a [Synergy
    Grant](https://erc.europa.eu/funding/synergy-grants), a large, €10
    million grant administered by the European Research Council. The
    grant seeks to greatly expand team science in the social sciences by
    establishing three Synergy Centers: the Evidence Synthesis Center
    led by Denny Borsboom, the Tools and Standards Center led by Lisa
    DeBruine, and the De-WEIRDing Center led by Hans IJzerman. The grant
    would deeply involve the PSA and provide it a substantial sum of
    discretionary money to be used as the PSA sees fit. Synergy Grants
    have three stages of review. Hans and Patrick will hear the results
    of the first stage in April.
-   **National Science Foundation grant to be submitted this week.**
    Chris Chartier, Neil Lewis, Jr., Heather Urry, Charlie Ebersole, and
    Hannah Moshontz have drafted a proposal to the NSF (our third try :)
    at this one) that will be submitted on the 15th. If funded, the
    grant would support hiring of a PSA dedicated project manager to
    allow us expanded data collection and more efficient overall
    workflow and study completion.
-   **John Templeton Foundation grant to be submitted this week.**
    Charlie Ebersole and Chris Chartier have drafted a proposal to the
    JTF that will be submitted on the 17th. If funded, the grant would
    support hiring of several dedicated PSA staff members to focus on
    collecting non-WEIRD samples for studies within the JTF human
    sciences division questions of interest.

## A Discussion on the PSA and Meta-Research

Peder M. Isager and Marcel van Assen hosted a discussion session titled
*How can meta-research improve the Psychological Science Accelerator
(PSA) and how can the PSA improve meta-research?* at the 2019
Meta-research day in Tilburg (<https://bit.ly/2sjzU3b>). The majority of
the session was devoted to discussing intersections between the
meta-research field and the PSA. The discussion is summarized in [this
blog
post](https://pedermisager.netlify.com/post/meta-research-at-the-psa/){target="_blank"}.

# Actionable Items to Kick Off 2020

## Study Selection

We are on the verge of making selection decisions for 8 submissions to
the PSA. All members who have created login credentials at [our
membership
site](https://member.psysciacc.org/index.php){target="_blank"} can now
access the pdf copies of these submissions and provide their ratings and
feedback. These forms will only be open for a week (until midnight on
the 20th in the last time zone on earth) to allow quick conclusion of
this round of study selection. We think you'll have fun looking at and
evaluating these excellent submissions! We also received a very
interesting, but quite atypical submission, that we are collating
feedback on. In response to our last call for studies, a research team
submitted a proposal that is not so much a specific study, but rather an
intriguing way in which we may select and develop a future study. The
SSC found that it had promise, but that it didn\'t fit our typical model
for submission review and selection. So, the SSC Assistant Directors
decided to pull the submission from the standard review track, and
instead begin a PSA-wide conversation to consider and eventually decide
by consensus (or perhaps vote) if we should implement the proposal.
Members, please provide your initial feedback by joining the
conversation currently ongoing in our general Slack channel (scroll up
to the thread beginning on November 27th).

## Resource Capacity Draft Policy Ready for Feedback

We (led by Patrick Forscher) have drafted a policy that lays out how the
PSA thinks about the resources that affect its capacity to run new
studies. The development of this policy was inspired in part by
questions from potential funders as to whether the PSA would be willing
to run studies about specific topics. The PSA does not, at present, have
guidelines for these decisions. The policy therefore also seeks to lay
out these guidelines. You can find a draft of the policy
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hdJesAgxjhgjRUUXFd3QQDcfouRPH1W2sdZRKlxbsME/edit#heading=h.fl1oceknqo2q).

## Elections and Appointments

One Associate Director position and several Assistant Director positions
will be up for election or appointment in the first quarter of 2020. We
will first hold a full network vote for the Associate Director seat.
Subsequently, the new line-up of Associate Directors and the Director
will vote to appoint the new Assistant Directors. For now, you can
consider and prepare for 3 things.

1.  Nominations for running for Associate Director: Any PSA member may
    run for this seat. We will be sending out a nomination form where
    people can nominate themselves or nominate someone else. We will
    confirm with all nominees as to whether or not they'd like to run.
2.  Volunteers to be Election Tellers: Each PSA election is overseen by
    one Associate Director and three Election Tellers. Tellers will
    observe all of the actions of the Associate Director (in this
    election, Charlie Ebersole) to confirm that the election is being
    run fairly and accurately. We will be seeking volunteers to serve as
    Tellers for the upcoming election; any PSA member can volunteer.
3.  Prepare to Vote: consider the performance of the current leadership
    team, and think about what you would most want to see out of new or
    returning members of this team in 2020 and beyond.

## Onward in 2020!

Thank you for all that you do. You can stay informed and in the convo on

(We also wanted to pass along this cool collaboration opportunity below,
being organized and led by PSA members) **The Transparent Psi Project is
looking for collaborators for data collection** Zoltan Kekecs and Balazs
Aczel (members of the PSA Methods Committee) are leading this project
which is an expert consensus-based **replication of one of Bem's 2011
precognition studies**. The project features state of the art methods to
maximize transparency and study integrity. The study involves a
computerized experiment taking about 20-30 minutes per session. Group
testing is possible in a computer lab, no specialized equipment needed.
Labs are expected to recruit at least 100 participants. Participants
will be exposed to images with explicit erotic/sexual content in the
experiment. No financial compensation is required for the participants.
Data collection is expected to take place in the 2020 spring, and if
needed, 2020 fall semester. Every material is provided for ethics/IRB
submissions and data collection in English (translation of materials
might be necessary by the collaborators). The study is pre-registered
and the manuscript is accepted in principle for publication (IPA) in the
journal [Royal Society Open
Science](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsos). Collaborators
in data collection get authorship on the paper. [Sign up
