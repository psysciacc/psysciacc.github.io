Accelerators,

We have a brief newsletter (https://psysciacc.org/news/2020-10-28_news-from-the-accelerator-october-2020.html) for you today, summarizing our activities in October 2020. For members, please be sure to read up on the new study capacity policy, and then cast your vote, through the member site. Thank you for everything you do for the PSA! I am wishing for peace, calm, and happiness for every single one of you today.
