Accelerators,

WOW! The PSA has been busy this past month! In this month's newsletter (https://psysciacc.org/news/2021-03-01_news-from-the-accelerator-february-2021.html) , you will see that our project leads have been working hard to keep our studies moving forward. We also have some exciting news on appointments of our Assistant Directors as well as an update of our current election for the Director and Associate Director positions. To get to know our newly appointed Assistant Directors, we have also incorporated an introductory statement for each of them. As always thank you for your continued support and collaboration and we look forward to what this next month will entail!
