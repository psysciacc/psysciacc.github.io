On August 26, 2017, Chris Chartier wrote a blog post posing a simple
question: what might happen if psychology adopted the collaborative "big
science" model seen in physics and built a "CERN for psychological
science"? 2018 gave us a glimpse of the answer: a rapidly-expanding
network of over 300 psychology labs from over fifty countries. The first
year was a flurry of activity as, in quick succession, the PSA accepted
four studies and had its first academic paper accepted. The network's
rapid expansion in its first year speaks to the hunger for ambitious
solutions to two of the problems that psychology currently faces:
lower-than-desired levels of replicability and generalizability of
psychological findings. The PSA's second year has marked the beginnings
of a transition from idea to action. The network has continued to
expand, now standing at over [500 labs from over 70
countries](https://nicholas-coles.shinyapps.io/PSA_Map_Prototype/){target="_blank"}.
We have selected 2 new studies, collected data from over 11,000
participants for our first study, initiated data collection in 3 other
studies, received in principle acceptance for 2 registered report
manuscripts, and submitted another 2 for stage 1 peer review. This
productivity in the selection, preparation, and conduct of our studies
was matched by a substantial organizational infrastructure development.
PSA members named Assistant Directors to lead the committees that do the
bulk of its administrative and coordination work, initiated a project to
formalize its study pipeline, drafted a coherent set of policies
dictating how the PSA manages and releases its data, made the PSA's
first full-time hire (Patrick Forscher at Université Grenoble Alpes),
announced the first round of PSA elections, created a Patreon, submitted
several grant proposals, and drafted a vision statement outlining the
PSA's long-term priorities. If the PSA's first year was focused on
growth and excitement, its second year was focused on *turning plans
into action and establishing sustainability*, and we hope our third year
is one of securing large-scale funding to more effectively pursue our
mission with six key aims:

1.  Collect samples that represent all people
2.  Train and support our global network of researchers
3.  Expand the PSA's capacity to include more complex behavioral studies
4.  Release large-scale data-sets that are maximally informative for
    secondary re-use
5.  Improve psychological science through meta-scientific and
    instructional contributions
6.  Expand capacity to conduct more, and bigger, studies

Below we have created a chronological timeline of important events in
the PSA. All of these accomplishments represent the work of literally
hundreds of researchers. We can't thank them enough for joining us on
this journey to accelerate psychological science. Here's to many more
productive and rewarding years ahead! **Timeline of important PSA events
