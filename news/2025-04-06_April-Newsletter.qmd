## PSA Member Update

Aüåç PSA member Hu Chuan-Peng led a collaborative paper titled " *Open Science in the Developing World: A Collection of Practical Guides for Researchers in Developing Countries* ", where the co-authors summarized the barriers they face in developing countries and provided a four-step guide for researchers in a resource-constrained context. Read more in the [preprint](https://osf.io/7ubk2)

üîé PSA members Max Korbmacher, Thomas Rhys Evans, Flavio Azevedo and Charlotte Pennington published " *International initiatives to enhance awareness and uptake of open research in psychology: a systematic mapping review* " in Royal Society Open Science. The review identified a total of 187 initiatives in open research in psychology: 30 were procedural (e.g., toolkits, resources, software), 70 structural (e.g., policies, strategies, frameworks) and 87 community-based (e.g. working groups, networks).
