August was a very productive and exciting month for the PSA. Here we
summarize last month\'s progress and activities, some exciting new
things coming in the near future, and make a few small requests of all
PSA members.

## PSA Member Site

We have been organizing information about PSA members in a shared google
sheet until now. This worked OK for a while, but as our network grew it
became disorganized, unwieldy, and error-prone. Lucky for us, Erin
Buchanan has been working hard on a new membership website (complete
with member database) and is ready for all PSA members to register and
provide some information. Eventually, we hope the site can become a
\"one stop shop\" for each PSA member to find information about the
status and next steps for any PSA studies they have joined, and any PSA
tasks that need new contributors. For now, we are asking all members of
the PSA t[o create an account on the site, login in, and complete the
member information
form](https://member.psysciacc.org/login.php){target="_blank"}. Erin
also put together t[his awesome tutorial
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZvD5Wi-KnI&feature=youtu.be){target="_blank"}
to walk you through the process!

## 2 Policy Documents are Open for PSA-wide Feedback

### Vision Statement

We have drafted and released a PSA [vision
statement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FiPxP9d2It6ULd87JiYd90UlzHCTeqLAH4GPZdA6Rk0/edit){target="_blank"}.
This document is a precursor to a more complete 5-year strategic plan to
be drafted in 2020. We welcome feedback this month before editing and
ultimately calling for a vote to make this statement a PSA policy.

### Analysis Plan Approval Policy

In future projects, the Data and Methods (DM) committee intends to
review the project analysis plan before the project is registered and/or
submitted for peer review. This process is meant to ensure that all
necessary components (sample size justification, analysis scripts, etc.)
are present in the analysis plan when it is submitted for external
review. Furthermore, the approval process should provide some minimum
reassurance that major methodological issues and flaws in the analysis
plan have been addressed before launch of data collection, in the very
rare cases that such flaws escape the awareness of the co-author team.
In line with the proposed guidelines for PSA policy proposals, the DM
committee have sought and incorporated feedback from the PSA director
and associate directors. We now invite all members of the PSA to provide
feedback on [the document, which can be found
here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DtoIMZoi3-a4nmgvQbV0LsbEH2xNMgRNnS94H6Jx3jo/edit?usp=sharing){target="_blank"}.
The document will be **open for feedback for one week** as of the
posting of this newsletter. After this period the DM committee will
incorporate feedback, and subsequently submit the policy for approval by
vote by PSA Directors and all members of the PSA.

## Policy Document up for a Vote

We now call for a vote on our [\"meta-policy\"
document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14D6GrE4i7FJejq_BUZ9DPC2bQfCb2PztdEB63QldOow/edit){target="_blank"}!
It describes how current PSA polices can be amended and how members can
propose new policies. All members will receive a separate email asking
for them to vote yes or no on this proposed policy document.

## The PSA Just Turned 2!

[August 26th marked two years of accelerating psychological science. To

## 2 PSA Members Suggest a Theory Committee

Peder Isager and Nick Coles have made a quite interesting suggestion -
that the PSA could use a theory committee - in [a recent
blogpost](https://pedermisager.netlify.com/post/psa-theory-committee/){target="_blank"}.
Have a read and let them know what you think!
