Accelerators,

We are now recruiting labs to contribute to the recently selected PSA study on moral decision making, “On the universality of moral thinking: Cross-cultural variation in the influence of personal force and intention in moral dilemma judgments,” led by Bence Bago and Balazs Aczel!

We are hoping to assemble a large and diverse team for this one. You can learn more and sign up using this form (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOq0IxbOV3PKCoRUE10NlIdRsZypeVqkl_bqdAVMsWRr-y_w/viewform) .

Please let us know if you have any questions about the project and be on the lookout for more general PSA updates and news coming in the form of our January newsletter at the end of this month.

Than you for all of your work on the PSA. Onward!
