### Study updates

-   **PSA-002 (Object Orientation):** The lead team is working through
    extensive feedback on the Stage 2 Registered Report submission from
    Psychonomic Bulletin and Review.
-   **PSA-003 (Gendered Prejudice):** The lead team has completed
    initial data analyses and is working on drafting a manuscript
    describing the results.
-   **PSA-004 (Accelerated CREP):** The lead team is working on data
    processing, data analysis, and authorship credit tracking. A group
    of collaborators were emailed the current version of the manuscript
    a few weeks ago.
-   **PSA-005 (Stereotype Threat):** Data collection continues. As of
    last week, the team has collected 571 participants across 29 sites!
-   **PSA-006 (Trolley Problem):** The manuscript has final acceptance
    at Nature Human Behaviour. The lead team is waiting to receive the
    final paper proofs.
-   **PSA-007 (SPAM-L):** The team received a favorable
    revise-and-resubmit on the Stage 1 registered report submitted to
    Nature Human Behaviour! The project team is now working on (a)
    addressing reviewer comments, (b) finalizing the experimental
    materials in lab.js, and (c) establishing a system for material
    translations. The project team will be sending updates in the near
    future regarding other ways to contribute. If you are interested in
    becoming a collaborator or want to learn more, **[e-mail the lead
    team](mailto:007spaml@gmail.com).**
-   **PSA- 008 (Minimal Groups):** The lead team thanks everyone who
    filled out the interest survey and will contact those who responded
    with onboarding instructions in early April. In the meantime, the
    lead team is working on a pilot study and a Stage 1 registered
    report. They aim to submit the manuscript to Nature Human Behaviour
    by the end of March. If you are interested in becoming a
    collaborator (and did *not* fill out the interest survey) or want to
    learn more about the project, **[e-mail
    Kathleen](mailto:kathleenschmidt1@gmail.com).**
-   **PSA-COVID Rapid Bundle (001/003)-**
    -   The PSACR-001 lead team is working on revising the manuscript at
        Affective Science. Collaborators have already submitted feedback
        and approved resubmission, so the paper will be resubmitting
        once those revisions are complete.
    -   PSACR-003 has been accepted at PNAS, but there are still some
        details being worked out with the journal (particularly
        regarding payment). Once those details are finalized,
        collaborators will be notified.
