Accelerators,

Today’s newsletter (https://psysciacc.org/news/2020-10-02_news-from-the-accelerator-august-september-2020.html) is double-sized, summarizing PSA activities from both August and September. It was a fun and busy 62 days with an election, some exciting news on publications, our first conference, and much more. As always, thank you for everything you do to accelerate psychological science. Happy reading!!
