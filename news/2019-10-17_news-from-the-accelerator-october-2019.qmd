Hi all, This month we have progress to report on our latest round of
study selection, our 6 current studies, a policy document up for a vote,
and an invitation to join a new PSA press team!

## Vote on the Analysis Plan Approval Policy

We now call for a vote on our [analysis plan approval
policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DtoIMZoi3-a4nmgvQbV0LsbEH2xNMgRNnS94H6Jx3jo/edit#heading=h.x22gltabenuo){target="_blank"}.
All members will receive a email asking for them to vote yes or no on
this proposed policy.

## Study Selection Update

We are now reviewing the 11 submissions we received in response to our
2019 call for studies. Initial feasibility checks are happening now (and
have actually been completed for several submissions). Peer review
requests will be made in the coming weeks. To participate in this
process in any way (viewing, rating, or reviewing submissions), you will
need to become an official PSA member through our new member website
here:
[https://member.psysciacc.org/](https://member.psysciacc.org/){target="_blank"}.
The more the merrier!

## Progress on All 6 Current Studies

[PSA 001](https://psysciacc.org/001-face-perception/){target="_blank"}
is nearing completion and we will submit the stage 2 manuscript to
Nature Human Behaviour, [release exploratory
data](https://psysciacc.org/2019/09/01/introducing-the-psa001-secondary-analysis-challenge/){target="_blank"},
and update our [preprint](https://psyarxiv.com/n26dy){target="_blank"}
all on October 31. [PSA
002](https://psyarxiv.com/t2pjv){target="_blank"}/[003](https://psysciacc.org/003-gendered-prejudice/){target="_blank"}
are moving quickly now with lots of recent activity on both translation
and data collection. Several teams have even completed collection for
these studies! [PSA 004](https://psyarxiv.com/zeux9){target="_blank"} is
also in a period of rapid progress with many teams finalizing their
materials and a handful of sites already collecting data. [PSA
005](https://psyarxiv.com/6hju9/){target="_blank"} recently received
some wonderful news, with a very favorable revise and resubmit decision
from Nature Human Behaviour on the stage 1 registered report manuscript.
The lead team is working on the revisions now. [PSA
006](https://psyarxiv.com/9uaqm/){target="_blank"} is back under review
as a stage 1 registered report at Nature Human Behaviour after its own
revise and resubmit decision. We hope to be hearing some good news soon!

## Would You Like to Join PSA's Press Team?

The PSA is looking for people who would like to help with press issues.
This is a great opportunity to either join the network or become more
involved. Potential tasks of the press team include:

-   Draft press releases
-   Contact bloggers, journalists, and media outlets with PSA updates
-   Organize contacts in PSA member university press offices
-   Write plain language summaries of PSA projects (for e.g. In-Mind,
    The Conversation, Psych Today, and other outlets that allow
    contributed articles)
-   Write Twitter threads, Facebook posts, etc.
-   Eventually coordinate TED-style talks

We will always provide the source info about the PSA and current studies
so even people who are not familiar with the structure, goals or are not
even sure what is going on in the PSA are welcome to volunteer! If
you\'re interested please send an email to
<psysciaccelerator@gmail.com>.
