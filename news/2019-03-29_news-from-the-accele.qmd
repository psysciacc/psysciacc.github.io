Accelerators,

You can read up on our last month of PSA activities in our March newsletter (https://psysciacc.org/news/2019-03-29_news-from-the-accelerator-march-2019.html) .

It includes updates on all 6 of our current studies, two new policy docs (including our new data management guidelines (https://psyarxiv.com/buqyc) ), our funding efforts (including our new crowdfunding campaign page (https://www.patreon.com/psysciacc) ), and more.

Thank you for all of your hard work on the PSA! Let us know if you have any questions, concerns, or updates on any PSA related projects.
