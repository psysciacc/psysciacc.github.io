Accelerators,

I'm writing with a very brief set of reminders about the upcoming conference (https://psysciacc.org/psa-2020-conference/). It is now less than two weeks away on September 7, 8, and 9!

If you are still interested in presenting, the last day to submit a proposal (https://psysciacc.org/the-2020-virtual-meeting-of-the-psychological-science-accelerator/psa-vc-2020-call-for-presenters/) is September 1. We have great sessions planned in all time-slots, but have plenty of room for adding concurrent sessions.

The last day to register for the conference (https://psysciacc.org/the-2020-virtual-meeting-of-the-psychological-science-accelerator/) will be September 3rd. Currently, we have ⅔ of our capacity full, so be sure to snag your seat now.

See you soon :)
