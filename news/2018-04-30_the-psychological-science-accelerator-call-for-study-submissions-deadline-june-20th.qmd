The Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA), a network of 300 labs
collaborating to collect large-scale international samples of
psychological data, is currently accepting study proposals from all
areas of psychological science. Anyone can submit a proposal, whether or
not they are a member of the PSA. Our mission is to accelerate the
accumulation of reliable and generalizable evidence in psychological
science, reducing the distance between truth about human behavior and
mental processes and our current understanding. For a full overview of
the PSA, please see our pre-print introducing our policies and
procedures
([https://psyarxiv.com/785qu/](https://psyarxiv.com/785qu/){target="_blank"}).
![Capture](images/capture.jpg){.alignnone
.size-full .wp-image-282 width="1022" height="522"} Proposed studies can
test novel hypotheses or focus on the replication of previous findings,
can be basic or applied in focus, and can be exploratory or confirmatory
in nature. Because accepted studies will likely involve considerable use
of resources, the study selection process begins with the preparation
and evaluation of a [Registered
Report](https://osf.io/8mpji/){target="_blank"} style submission by
authors hoping to collect data via the PSA network. Our Study Selection
Committee will conduct an initial feasibility evaluation for all
proposed studies (see below for more information on this feasibility
check). Studies that pass this check will be evaluated by 10 peer
reviewers and ourStudy Selection Committee for final selection. We plan
to accept 2-3 studies during this round of review. Selected studies will
then proceed through the PSA workflow depicted in the figure below.

.size-full .wp-image-284 width="1280" height="676"} Please email
submissions to our Director, Dr. Christopher R. Chartier,
cchartie@ashland.edu. Submissions will be accepted until June 20th,
2018.

## Feasibility

All feasibility decisions are made with respect to our current, and ever
changing, resources. Although the PSA is comprised of hundreds of labs
from around the world who have agreed to volunteer some of their
resources to PSA projects, we are currently unable to accommodate all
types of designs. Submissions are more likely to pass the initial
feasibility check if they have the following characteristics:

-   Do not require specialized equipment (e.g., eye-tracking, EEG) or
    proprietary experimental software (e.g., E-Prime) to be used at the
    data collection sites, unless the proposing team can provide these
    resources to data collection labs
-   Experimental materials and analysis scripts can be shared easily and
    made publicly available
-   Do not require hard-to-reach samples (e.g., clinical populations).
    We hope to better accommodate such sampling in the future.
-   Target sample size per site is less than 150 participants
-   Target number of data collection sites is less than 150
-   Duration of an individual data collection session is less than 90
    minutes
-   The likelihood and severity of risk to the participant is kept to a
    minimum, such that the risk is not greater than what participants
    would face normally and would not require special consideration or
    deliberation from an ethics board.

## **Characteristics of strong submissions** {#characteristics-of-strong-submissions style="text-align:center;"}

Beyond simply being feasible given current PSA resources, strong
submissions will also:

-   Accurately and clearly describe literature relevant to the study's
    goals and design, such that researchers unfamiliar with the subject
    can understand the basic concepts behind the theory/phenomenon and
    the purpose of the research.
-   Clearly articulate the purpose of the research, relevant research
    questions, and hypotheses.
-   Clearly articulate the research design, with a focus on sound
    methodology appropriate to the research questions, including
    adequate power analysis to justify sample size.
-   Provide examples of relevant material, for example websites,
    experimental scripts (e.g., E-prime, Inquist, OpenSesame), precise
    experimental design, and/or stimuli.
-   Accurately and clearly describe an analysis strategy appropriate to
    the research questions and design. Pilot or simulated data and
    working analysis scripts are ideal for clarity.
-   Make a compelling case for the importance of large-scale
    collaborative data collection.

## **Submission Format and Guidelines** {#submission-format-and-guidelines style="text-align:center;"}

The following components are required for all submissions:

-   Cover Page, including title of the study, date of the latest draft,
    and keywords
-   Abstract of up to 150 words
-   Main body submission text of up to 5,000 words
-   References
-   Supplementary materials

The following guidelines are intended to assist you in the preparation
of your study submission to the Psychological Science Accelerator.
Submissions normally include a description of the key background
literature and motivation for the study, hypotheses, study procedures,
proposed statistical analysis plan, a statistical power analysis, and
pilot data (wherever applicable). 

### Introduction

A review of the relevant literature that motivates the research question and a full
description of the study aims and hypotheses. 

### Methods

A full description of proposed sample characteristics, including criteria for
data inclusion and exclusion (e.g. outlier extraction). Procedures for
objectively defining exclusion criteria due to technical errors or for
any other reasons must be specified, including details of how and under
what conditions data would be replaced. A description of study
procedures in sufficient detail to allow another researcher to repeat
the methodology exactly, without requiring further information. Proposed
analysis pipeline, including all preprocessing steps, and a precise
description of all planned analyses, including appropriate correction
for multiple comparisons. Specify all covariates or regressors. Specify
analysis decisions that are contingent on the outcome of prior analyses.

### Results

Studies involving Neyman-Pearson inference must include a
statistical power analysis. Estimated effect sizes should be justified
with reference to the existing literature or theory. Since publication
bias overinflates published estimates of effect size, power analysis
should be based on the lowest available or meaningful estimate of the
effect size. In the case of highly uncertain effect sizes, a variable
sample size and interim data analysis is permissible but with inspection
points stated in advance, [appropriate Type I error correction for
'peeking' employed](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2023){target="_blank"}, and a final stopping rule for data collection outlined. For studies
involving analyses with Bayes factors, the predictions of the theory
must be specified so that a Bayes factor can be calculated. Authors
should indicate what distribution will be used to represent the
predictions of the theory and how its parameters will be specified. Full
descriptions must be provided of any outcome-neutral criteria that must
be met for successful testing of the stated hypotheses. Such quality
checks might include the absence of floor or ceiling effects in data
distributions, positive controls, or other quality checks that are
orthogonal to the experimental hypotheses. 

### Supplemental Materials

Include full questionnaires, stimuli, and materials needed to conduct
the study. Pilot data can be included to establish proof of concept,
effect size estimations, or feasibility of proposed methods. Simulated
data and analysis scripts are ideal for clarity of the exclusion
criteria and analysis plan. *These guidelines were adapted from
