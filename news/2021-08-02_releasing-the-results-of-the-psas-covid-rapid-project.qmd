On March 13, 2020, the PSA put out a
[call](https://psysciacc.org/2020/03/13/the-psa-calls-for-rapid-and-impactful-study-proposals-on-covid-19/)
for rapid and impactful studies on the psychological aspects of the
COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of the call was to initiate the PSA's
COVID-Rapid Project, or PSACR, which would test whether our "big team
science" model of massively collaborative psychology could contribute to
a psychological understanding of the pandemic.

Now, a year and a quarter later, PSACR is bearing its first fruit. The
scope of the project is staggering. According to our [project
methods](https://psyarxiv.com/x976j), our project produced three core
studies, a general health behavior survey, a dataset spanning over
47,000 participants and 44 languages and dialects in 110 countries, with
a team of 467 collaborators. Moreover, we produced all these products on
a budget of a bit less than \$17,000 USD -- of which \$7,000 was donated
by PSA members.

Just as impressive were the hurdles we had to overcome to produce these
results. We obtained ethics approval across all our data collection
sites, a process that involved huge administrative back-and-forth. We
coordinated a translation team of at least 268, who completed forward
translation, backward translation, and cultural adjustment processes. We
coordinated 18 lab grants and the purchase of 15 semi-representative
panels. We maintained two servers for data collection, programmed the
project in 44 languages in formr, and completed a massive process of
debugging. To maintain quality control, we coordinated a process of
internal review before executing the project and revision processes when
writing the papers that communicated the results.

We believe that our scientific results justify this massive effort. Our
project has produced three highly precise and global tests of questions
that are both theoretically and practically important. Moreover, we have
produced a huge array of project materials in 44 languages, as well as a
massive, meticulously documented dataset ripe for secondary analysis. We
hope our three core studies are the first of many scientific
contributions that PSACR will produce and inspire.

None of these achievements would have been possible without the PSA's
most valuable resource, its members. PSA members gave freely and
generously of their skills and resources to make this project happen.
Moreover, given that the author lists for these projects exceed 400,
they did so knowing that they might not receive adequate compensation
for their effects in the currency that most matters in academia, credit.

We list the main materials of the PSACR project below. Below that, we
profile five contributors to this project. We chose these contributors
to highlight people from different countries and project roles -- and
especially some of our many stellar contributors who are early in their
careers. Although we do not have space to profile all 467 of our
contributors, we hope this does something to make visible some of the
many [invisible
contributions](https://psysciacc.org/2019/08/29/recognizing-invisible-labor-in-the-psa/)
to the PSACR project.

#### **PSACR Study 001 Loss/Gain (**[**preprint**](https://psyarxiv.com/sevkf/)  *currently pre-data***;** [**OSF**](https://osf.io/m6q8f/)**)**

A global test of message framing on behavioural intentions, policy
support, information seeking, and experienced anxiety during the
COVID-19 pandemic

*Abstract:* The COVID-19 pandemic presents a critical need to identify
best practices for communicating health information to the global
public. It also provides an opportunity to test theories about risk
communication. As part of a larger Psychological Science Accelerator
COVID-19 Rapid Project, a global consortium of researchers will
experimentally test competing hypotheses regarding the effects of
framing messages in terms of losses versus gains. We will examine
effects on three primary outcomes: intentions to adhere to policies
designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19, opinions about such
policies, and the likelihood that participants seek additional policy
information. Whereas research on negativity bias and loss aversion
predicts that loss-framing will have greater impact, research on
encouraging the adoption of protective health behaviour suggests the
opposite (i.e., gain-framing will be more persuasive). We will also
assess effects on experienced anxiety. Given the potentially low cost
and the scalable nature of framing interventions, results could be
valuable to health organizations, policymakers, and news sources
globally.

#### **PSACR Study 002 Reappraisal (**[**preprint**](https://psyarxiv.com/m4gpq/)**;** [**OSF**](https://osf.io/4yf9d/)**)**

A global test of brief reappraisal interventions on emotions during the
COVID-19 pandemic

*Abstract:* The COVID-19 pandemic has increased negative emotions and
decreased positive emotions globally. Left unchecked, these emotional
changes might have a wide array of adverse impacts. To reduce negative
emotions and increase positive emotions, we tested the effectiveness of
reappraisal, an emotion regulation strategy which modifies how one
thinks about a situation. Participants from 87 countries/regions (N =
21,644) were randomly assigned to one of two brief reappraisal
interventions (reconstrual or repurposing) or one of two control
conditions (active or passive). Results revealed that both reappraisal
interventions (vs. both control conditions) had consistent effects in
reducing negative emotions and increasing positive emotions across
different measures. Reconstrual and repurposing had similar effects.
Importantly, planned exploratory analyses indicated that reappraisal
interventions did not reduce intentions to practice preventive health
behaviours. The findings demonstrate the viability of creating scalable,
low-cost interventions for use around the world to build resilience
during the pandemic and beyond.

#### **PSACR Study 003 Self Determination (**[**preprint**](https://psyarxiv.com/n3dyf/)  *currently under revision***;** [**OSF**](https://osf.io/myxzk/)**)**

A Global Experiment on Motivating Social Distancing during the COVID-19
Pandemic

*Abstract*: Finding communication strategies that can effectively
motivate social distancing continues to be a global public health
priority during the COVID-19 pandemic as people around the world wait to
be vaccinated. This cross-country preregistered experiment (n=25,718
from 89 countries) tested hypotheses concerning generalizable positive
and negative outcomes of different motivational messages encouraging
social distancing that either promoted personal agency (i.e., autonomy
supportive), or pressured people with shaming and blaming tactics (i.e.,
controlling). Participants were randomly assigned to three conditions:
an autonomy-supportive message promoting reflective choices, a
controlling message that was restrictive and shaming, or no message,
which functioned to capture the real-life communications participants
had been receiving. Results partially supported experimental hypotheses:
the controlling message elicited more defiance relative to the
autonomy-supportive message and increased controlled motivation
(engaging in social distancing out of guilt and fear of social
consequences) relative to no message, but messages did not influence
behavioral intentions. Additionally, motivation to engage in social
distancing out of guilt and fear of consequences correlated with more
defiance and less long-term behavioral intentions to engage in social
distancing, whereas motivation to engage in social distancing out of a
true understanding of why the rules are important and necessary yielded
the opposite patterns. Overall, this work highlights the potential harm
of using shaming and pressuring language in public health communication.

Migs is a long-time contributor to the PSA, first as a member of the
Translation and Cultural Diversity committee, and more recently as the
new Assistant Director of the Community Building and Network Expansion
Committee (CBNEC). With the committee, he has co-organized the monthly
PSA coffee hours, Slack engagement threads, the onboarding/welcome
channel and is currently organizing a more targeted recruitment of PSA
members in world regions that are under-represented in current
memberships. With PSA working groups, he is also planning to establish
an accessible expertise sharing within the PSA ("The Hub") and to
establish regional support groups that aims to increase culture
sensitive and culturally specific research approaches. In the past Migs
organized no less than three sessions for
[PSACON2020](https://psysciacc.org/psacon2020-videos/) and has been a
frequent contributor on topics related to translation and measurement in
different cultural contexts. For PSACR, Migs helped lead the development
of the health behavior survey that accompanied the three core PSACR
studies and was the language-wide coordinator for the Filipino versions
of the PSACR project. 

#### **Biljana Gjoneska**

Biljana is a Research Associate at the Macedonian Academy of Sciences
and Arts. She has a passion for multinational studies and has
participated in eight, four of which were PSA projects. Biljana also
loves truly global initiatives like the PSA, where she strives to
increase the visibility of her beautifully weird and non-WEIRD country
(North Macedonia) in the domains of social psychology and social
neuroscience.

:::

Biljana is a more recent member of the PSA but has nevertheless been an
extremely active contributor. She has participated in numerous
PSA-sponsored hack-a-thons, including one on the PSA's study selection
process at PSACON2020. At PSACON2020, she presented a concept for
auction of studies, that may help facilitate discussions and
decision-making processes for preselection of PSA proposals. Her
cumulative experiences with the PSA community inspired her to contribute
to the PSA as one of its leaders; she was recently appointed as an
Assistant Director on the PSA's Ethics Committee. For PSACR, Biljana was
the language-wide coordinator for Macedonian, for which she managed a
team of five to complete the forward translations, backward
translations, and cultural adjustments of our three core studies and the
health behavior survey. Bilijana also contributed to the coding of
location data for the general dataset; these data serve as the basis for
the focal inferences in the three core studies.

#### **İlker Dalgar**

İlker is an Assistant Professor at Ankara Medipol University. He is also
working on co-founding the Turkey Open Science Initiative, which aims to
promote open and robust research practices, facilitate big team science,
and facilitate discussion of and training related to research issues in
Turkey.

:::

İlker has been a long-time contributor to the PSA as an Assistant
Director of the Translation and Cultural Diversity Committee. In this
role, İlker helped develop the PSA's translation procedures and
standards, which have by now been implemented in nine PSA studies. İlker
has also led or assisted with three PSA-themed grant proposals, all
focused around increasing the participation from researchers in world
regions currently underrepresented in the PSA network. For PSACR, İlker
served as the language-wide coordinator for Turkish, managing a team of
thirteen to complete forward and backward translations, as well as
cultural adjustments, for all three core studies and our health behavior
survey.

#### **Maximilian Primbs**

Max is finishing his Research Master's in Behavioural Science. In fall,
2021, Max will begin a PhD at Radboud University, the Netherlands, where
he will study situational models of implicit bias.

Even though Max joined the PSACR project very early in his career, he
shouldered a huge responsibility as the project's primary translation
coordinator. For a project involving 44 languages, three primary
studies, and a health behavior survey, as well as a translation team of
at least 268 people, this was an enormous responsibility. The
translation procedure was also more involved than is typical for many
projects, involving separate forward translation, backward translation,
and cultural adjustment stages. Max rose to the occasion, ensuring this
massive task got done in a timely way and assisting team members with
troubleshooting when issues inevitably arose. This huge responsibility
whet Max's appetite for "big team science"; Max ran for and won a seat
as an Assistant Director of the Translation and Cultural Diversity
Committee and has helped organize two PSA-themed conference submissions.

#### **Savannah Lewis**

Savannah was a long-time research assistant in Chris Chartier's lab. She
has now transitioned into an Assistant Director position at the Ashland
University International Collaborative Research Center. She will soon be
looking for PhD programs, likely starting in 2022.

Savannah was among the PSA's first crop of interns. She has been the
invisible glue holding the PSA together, safeguarding the PSA's
transition into a full-fledged organization. She has done everything
from organizing the PSA's first conference, PSACON2020, to running the
PSA's newsletters, to administering PSA004 Accelerated CREP. For the
PSACR projects, Savannah assisted with general administration and
technical implementation. In these capacities, she helped manage the
master spreadsheet that tracked general project progress and the complex
web of interlocking spreadsheets and software that transformed the 44
language versions of the PSACR project into 44 functioning formr
surveys.
