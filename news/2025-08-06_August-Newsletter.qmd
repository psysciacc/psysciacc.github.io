## PSA NEWS

As we transition into a new chapter, the Directors (Savannah & Erin) want to take a moment to express our heartfelt appreciation for Max, who has served as our Research Coordinator and Newsletter Lead over the past year.

Max has been instrumental in keeping you (our network) up to date on all the exciting things happening across the PSA. From helping manage and move JTF projects forward, to adding members to Canvas, to fine-tuning the many newsletter processes we've experimented with, Maxâ€™s flexibility, thoughtfulness, and commitment have helped make our behind-the-scenes work much smoother and more connected.

We're so grateful for everything Max brought to the team and network. Thank you, Max!
