title: "The Psychological Science Accelerator's First Year"

Today marks the 1 year anniversary of the [blog
post](https://christopherchartier.com/2017/08/26/building-a-cern-for-psychological-science/)
that started what would eventually evolve into the [Psychological
Science Accelerator](https://psysciacc.org/). In the brief post, I
introduced the idea of a distributed laboratory network in psychological
science, which I first called a "CERN for Psychological Science":

> What would a CERN for Psych look like? It certainly would not be a
> massive, centralized facility housing multi-billion dollar equipment.
> It would instead be comprised of a distributed network of hundreds,
> perhaps thousands, of individual data collection laboratories around
> the world working collaboratively on shared projects. These projects
> would not just be replications efforts, but also tests of the most
> exciting and promising hypotheses in the field.

They say timing is everything, and based on the immediate and
enthusiastic response (mostly via twitter), this was clearly an idea
whose time had come. Today, the PSA is one-year old, and is building the
necessary capacity to fulfill the potential that so many of you saw in
it back on August 26th, 2017. Here, I highlight a select list of
noteworthy events, moments, and accomplishments from our first year, and
welcome all psychological scientists to join in us in pursuing a
fully-fledged team science model for the field.

# Year 1 Highlights

-   September 3rd, 2017: the network reached 50 member labs.
-   September 5th, 2017: we issued our first [call for study
    submissions](https://christopherchartier.com/2017/09/05/update-building-a-cern-for-psychological-science/).
-   September 19th, 2017: the still nameless network reached 100 member
    labs.
-   September 21st, 2017: we decided, by vote of the network, to call
    our project "[The Psychological Science
    Accelerator](https://christopherchartier.com/2017/09/21/the-psychological-science-accelerator-a-distributed-laboratory-network/),"
    maintaining an allusion to massively collaborative projects in
    Physics.

    announced](https://christopherchartier.com/2017/10/03/the-psychological-science-accelerator-rapid-progress-more-help-needed/).
    This team shepherded the PSA from a general idea into a functioning
    collaborative project. These individuals deserve immense credit for
    getting us off the ground and ensuring that our early momentum
    turned into real action: Sau-Chin Chen,, Lisa DeBruine, Charlie
    Ebersole, Hans IJzerman, Steve Janssen, Melissa Kline, Darko
    Lončarić, and Heather Urry.
-   November 8th, 2017: we selected our [first
    study](https://psysciacc.org/news/2017-11-08_the-psychological-science-accelerators-first-study.html),
    proposed by Ben Jones, Lisa DeBruine, and Jess Flake.
-   November 8th, 2017: the PSA was covered in [Science
    Magazine](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/11/new-accelerator-aims-bring-big-science-psychology).
-   December 5th, 2017: we selected our [second
    study](https://psysciacc.org/news/2017-12-05_accepted-for-2018-gendered-social-category-representations.html),
    proposed by Curtis Phills.
-   December 13th, 2017: the PSA was covered in
    [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-teamwork-solve-one-of-psychologys-biggest-problems/).
-   January 18th, 2018: the PSA reached 200 member labs.
-   January 24th, 2018: we selected our [third
    study](https://psysciacc.org/news/2018-01-24_new-study-accepted-the-object-orientation-effect.html),
    proposed by Sau-Chin Chen.
-   April 3rd, 2018: the PSA was covered in
    [BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemlee/psychology-science-accelerator-replication#.up37Yy0xj).
-   April 8th, 2018: we announced the [Accelerated
    CREP](https://psysciacc.org/news/2018-04-08_the-accelerated-crep.html) study
    (our fourth), a collaboration with the [Collaborative Replication
    and Education Project](https://osf.io/wfc6u/), focusing on training
    students through the conduct of replication studies.
-   April 18th, 2018: we collected [our first
    data](https://twitter.com/PsySciAcc/status/986669596030709767), as
    part of a pilot test for bundling studies 2 and 3 in a single data
    collection session.
-   April 30th, 2018: we issued our second [call for
    studies](https://psysciacc.org/news/2018-04-30_the-psychological-science-accelerator-call-for-study-submissions-deadline-june-20th.html).
-   July 11th, 2018: the [Stage 1 Registered Report
    manuscript](https://psyarxiv.com/n26dy/) for study 1 received a
    "revise and resubmit" decision from *Nature Human Behaviour*.
-   July 20th, 2018: our [intro paper](https://psyarxiv.com/785qu/),
    laying out the policies and procedures of the PSA, was accepted for
    publication at *Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological
    Science*.
-   August 23rd, 2018: the PSA was mentioned in [the
    Guardian](https://psych-sci-accelerator.slack.com/messages/C7D9CRWCC/convo/CATCU5EC8-1534396568.000100/)
    as a positive example of change in the field.
-   The near future: our 4 empirical projects will likely begin primary
    data collection in the coming months. All are at various stages of
    preparation or review as Registered Reports, so the timelines are
    still a bit uncertain, but our best current estimates see study 1
    commencing in \~October 2018, studies 2 and 3 commencing in
    \~December 2018, and the Accelerated CREP commencing in
    \~January 2019. Interested researchers can still sign up for any of
    these studies. Feel free to email us (<psysciaccelerator@gmail.com>)
    for more information.

This has been an amazing, awe inspiring, humbling, and motivating first
year for the Psychological Science Accelerator. We have established many
of the policies, practices, procedures, and institutional norms to make
this project a success in the years to come. Here's hoping our next year
is one of capitalizing on our potential and beginning to make a real and
lasting impact on psychological science! Allow me to close with a direct
quote from our introductory paper, co-authored with over 100 members of
the PSA:

> Success in this endeavor is far from certain. However, striving
> towards collaborative, multi-lab, and culturally diverse research
> initiatives like the PSA can allow the field to not only advance
> understanding of specific phenomena and potentially resolve past
> disputes in the empirical literature, but they can also advance
> methodology and psychological theorizing. We thus call on all
> researchers with an interest in psychological science, regardless of
> discipline or area, representing all world regions, having large or
> small resources, being early or late in career, to join us and
> transform the PSA into a powerful tool for gathering reliable and
> generalizable evidence about human behavior and mental processes. If
> you are interested in joining the project, or getting regular updates

# 364 Labs in 365 Days

At the moment of posting this, we are now up to exactly 364 member
laboratories, just 1 lab short of our goal of growing the network to 365
labs in our first 365 days! Help us reach our arbitrary-but-fun goal of
recruiting 1 new member of the PSA every day of our first year by
signing up and joining this amazing team of researchers! A few of our
current members passed along their reflections on joining the project.
Read below if you need a smile or another good reason or two to join
this community.

> PSA. We are still figuring it all out, but every other week a group of
> us, across at least 3 time zones, get together to discuss the data and
> methods aspects of the PSA. What started as an interest in stats has

-Jess Flake

> I still remember that I felt so proud when I could show to my students
> that Catanzaro - a town located in one of the most impoverished areas
> in Southern Italy - was on the PSA map. I felt like that for many
> reasons. One of them is that the bachelor programme in Psychology at
> the University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro started just two years ago.
> We are only a few teachers, the most of us at the very beginning of
> our careers, passionate about our job and willing to provide our
> students with the most advanced and updated knowledge about what is
> going on in our field. I dedicated more than one lecture in my Methods
> class on the importance of reproducibility/replicability and on how
> Psychology is moving forward, thanks to the spreading of Open Access
> practices, pre-registration, and the PSA. I hope that my students will
> feel proud to know that they are not at the margins of this
> revolution, but rather embrace it and take part in this exciting
> adventure, which is growing and becoming more and more ambitious every
> month. Thank you for building it.

> team-based and rigorous science.

-Lisa de Bruine

> As a HDR Graduate student in psychology, my involvement in the PSA has
> tremendously increased my knowledge of experimental methods. I have
> had no previous experience with open science, replication, and
> registered reports. I believe that open science is the future of

> contacts and networks. I would encourage everyone to be involved in
> this exciting network of researchers.
