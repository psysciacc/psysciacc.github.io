Lab recruitment for the first official PSA study has far exceeded our
wildest expectations. The study is now back under review (following a
revise and resubmit decision) at *Nature Human Behaviour* as a Stage 1
Registered Report. This means that we are having our critical rounds of
peer review now, prior to data collection. You can read the current
draft of the manuscript
[here](https://psyarxiv.com/n26dy){target="_blank"}. The study will test
the generalizability of the valence-dominance model of face perception
across world regions, specifically: Africa, Asia, Australia and New
Zealand, Central America and Mexico, Eastern Europe, the Middle East,
the USA and Canada, Scandinavia, South America, the UK, and Western
Europe. Our currently planned minimum N is greater than 9,000.

We are extremely excited to have such a large
and diverse team involved, but the project could still be strengthened
by additional contributions from a few key world regions. While we no
longer need labs in most world regions, we would warmly welcome
additional labs from:

-   Africa
-   Central America
-   Mexico
-   The Middle East
-   Scandinavia

Luckily, we can still expand our team of data collection labs and have
the efforts of new labs recognized via authorship on the final published
report, thanks to some excellent flexibility in the RR submission model
at NHB. Data collection will begin as soon as possible (this depends on
editorial decisions at NHB) and run through early September 2019. Please
pass this information along to colleagues in the above regions who you
think would be interested in contributing. Sign up for the PSA network
