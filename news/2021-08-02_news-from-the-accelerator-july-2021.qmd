we have thus far been able to accommodate all members who have requested
free access to the conference. We look forward to seeing you there! 

## **Study updates:**

-   **PSA-002 (Object Orientation) PSA-003 (Gendered Prejudice):** Data
    collection for 002 and 003 is officially complete! The 002 and 003
    teams are now working on data cleaning and executing the
    pre-registered analysis plans. The lead team will be reaching out to
    the data collection teams for help with the coding of text responses
    soon**.**
-   **PSA-004 (Accelerated CREP):** The leadership team is currently
    working on data processing, data analysis, and authorship credit
    tracking.
-   **PSA-005 (Stereotype Threat):** Given the progress of vaccination
    in the US, we are hoping to collect data in the Fall! Each
    collaborator should have been added to the Canvas course. If you
    have not please email

    II submission to *Nature Human Behavior.*

        officially published, but hopefully, it will show up online
        soon.

        expects to send out the revised manuscript with a draft author
        list, the revision letter, and the reviews to collaborators in
        the first week of August.

The PSA is slowly integrating our new membership website to Canvas.
Canvas is designed for teaching, so many of the terms online are focused
on teaching - but we plan to explore Canvas as a project management
tool. We will be starting to add in every member in the next couple of
months.

At this moment, there isn't anything you will need to do as of right
now.
