<p>The PSA is slowly integrating our new membership website to Canvas. Canvas is designed for teaching, so many of the terms online are focused on teaching - but we plan to explore Canvas as a project management tool. We will be starting to add in every member in the next couple of months. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">At this moment, there isnâ€™t anything you will need to do as of right now.</span></p>
