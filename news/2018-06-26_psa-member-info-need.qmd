Accelerators,

I write today with only one brief request. We have updated our sign-up form to more completely assess the types of non-data collection contributions that members are interested in making. We need to get this information from our existing members, and not just those who sign-up now, particularly with our new batch of study submissions (we received 5) to review in the coming weeks. So, when you have a few free minutes, please fill out this brief form (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_x9UNOjUkaKFJZjOXdaQ9OsTUtUliwZFZRmoNSr9zh78Ldg/viewform) to let us know the types of PSA activities you would like to get involved in. Thank you so much!
